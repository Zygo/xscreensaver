/* The unportable mess that is rand(), random(), drand48() and friends led me
   to ask Phil Karlton <karlton@netscape.com> what the Right Thing to Do was.
   He responded with this.  It is non-cryptographically secure, reasonably
   random (more so than anything that is in any C library), and very fast.

   I don't understand how it works at all, but he says "look at Knuth,
   Vol. 2 (original edition), page 26, Algorithm A.  In this case n=55,
   k=24 and m=2^32."

   So there you have it.

   ---------------------------
   Note: xlockmore 4.03a10 uses this very simple RNG:

	if ((seed = seed % 44488 * 48271 - seed / 44488 * 3399) < 0)
	  seed += 2147483647;
	return seed-1;

   of which it says

	``Dr. Park's algorithm published in the Oct. '88 ACM  "Random Number
	  Generators: Good Ones Are Hard To Find" His version available at
	  ftp://cs.wm.edu/pub/rngs.tar Present form by many authors.''

   Karlton says: ``the usual problem with that kind of RNG turns out to
   be unexepected short cycles for some word lengths.''

   Karlton's RNG is faster, since it does three adds and two stores, while the
   xlockmore RNG does two multiplies, two divides, three adds, and one store.

   Compiler optimizations make a big difference here:
       gcc -O:     difference is 1.2x.
       gcc -O2:    difference is 1.4x.
       gcc -O3:    difference is 1.5x.
       SGI cc -O:  difference is 2.4x.
       SGI cc -O2: difference is 2.4x.
       SGI cc -O3: difference is 5.1x.
