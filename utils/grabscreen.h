/* This will write an image onto the given Drawable.
   The Drawable (arg 3) may be a Window or a Pixmap.

   The Window must be the top-level window.  The image *may or may not*
   be written to the window, though it will definitely be written to
   the drawable.  It's fine for args 2 and 3 to be the same window, or
   for arg 2 to be a Window, and arg 3 to be a Pixmap.

   The loaded image might be from a file, or from a screen shot of the
   desktop, or from the system's video input, depending on user
   preferences.

   When the callback is called, the image data will have been loaded
   into the given drawable.  Copy `name' if you want to keep it.

   If it is from a file, then the `filename' argument will be the name
   of the file.  It may be NULL.  If you want to keep this string, copy it.

   The size and position of the image is in the `geometry' arg.
   The image will generally have been scaled up to fit the window, but
   if a loaded file had a different aspect ratio than the window, it
   will have been centered, and the returned coords will describe that.

   Many colors may be allocated from the window's colormap.
