 *
 * Revision History:
 * 01-Nov-2000: Allocation checks
 * 23-Jul-1999: Unleashed on an unsuspecting world
 * 29-Jun-1999: More hacking by Jeremy Buhler (jbuhler@cs.washington.edu)
 *              - fix memory-related bugs found by xlock maintainer
 *              - properly reinitialize screen with new size when init()
 *                is called multiple times
 *              - reinstate multiple final characters (suggested by
 *                Joan Touzet)
 *              - reduce delay to 1 ms (provisionally)
 *              - decouple pixmap height from screen height, to permit
 *                less memory use and shorter, more frequent updates
 *                (for smoother scrolling on slow boxes, but nothing
 *                will help if the machine is busy.  Also restores
 *                broken display on very small windows).
 *              - nevertheless, certain display parameters such as the
 *                interval between column speed updates should depend on
 *                the screen height -- enforce this at runtime.
 *              - fix column spacing to use entire window
 *              - remove redundant size fields from matrix_t and column_t
 *                structures -- rely on character size and window size
 *                instead.
 *              - consistently use PICK_MATRIX() instead of passing
 *                mp as a parameter whenever the active screen is
 *                implicitly required.
 * 27-Jun-1999: Overhauled by Jeremy Buhler (jbuhler@cs.washington.edu)
 *              - use screen-to-screen copies as much as possible
 *              - get by with a single pixmap per column instead of two
 *              - try to optimize draw_matrix() and new_column() as much
 *                as humanly possible
 *              - fixed double-freeing in release_matrix()
 *              - increased delay to 10 ms to prevent hyperfast scrolling
 *              - minor cleanups; removed unused or duplicate code/data
 * 26-Jun-1999: Tweaks by Jeremy Buhler (jbuhler@cs.washington.edu)
 *              - Use larger Katakana font with numbers
 *              - tweak character colors
 *              - change string and gap distributions for lower screen density
 *              - Matrix strings end with a fixed character
 *              - fix scrolling artifacts due to gaps between two column
 *                pixmaps
 *              - minor code cleanups to allow future parameterization
 *                of speed, density
 * 09-Jun-1999: Tweaks by Joan Touzet to look more like the original film's
 *              effects
 * 22-Apr-1999: Initial version

   *
   * There are two tricky bits to this scheme.  First, we must keep a
   * pointer (yPtr) to the pixmap contents which should be used to
   * fill in the top rows of each column.  yPtr is decremented on each
   * call to draw_matrix(); when it reaches zero, the column's pixmap
   * may be redrawn to generate new characters for the column.
   *
   * Second, the scroll increment corresponding to <speed> need not be a
   * multiple of the pixmap height. We must special-case the handling of the
   * last decrement that makes yPtr <= 0 to ensure that the last few pixels
   * of the old data AND the first few pixels of the new data are both drawn.
   * It turns out to be quite reasonable to do the pixmap update inline,
   * between drawing the last few old pixels and the first few new pixels.
   * Hence, we can achieve smooth scrolling with only one pixmap per column.
