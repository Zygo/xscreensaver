 * XScreenSaver Daemon, version 6.
 *
 * This is "xscreensaver-auth" -- When the screen is locked and there is
 * user activity, this program is launched to pop up a dialog, authenticate
 * the user, and eventually exit with a status code indicating success or
 * failure.  See the comment atop xscreensaver.c for details of the division
 * of powers.
 *
 * Flow of control within xscreensaver-auth:
 *
 *   - Privileged password initialization (e.g. read /etc/shadow as root)
 *   - Disavow privileges
 *   - Unprivileged password initialization
 *   - Connect to X server
 *   - xss_authenticate (passwd.c)
 *       - Tries PAM, Kerberos, pwent, shadow passwords (passwd-*.c) until
 *         one of them works.  Non-PAM methods are wrapped to act like PAM.
 *       - pam_conv calls our "conversation" function zero or more times.
 *         That function is expected to present messages to the user and/or
 *         to prompt the user to answer a question, wait for the answer, and
 *         return it.  There might be only one question (the password) or
 *         there might be others, even multiple passwords.
 *           - xscreensaver_auth_conv (dialog.c) is our conversation function.
 *               - First time it is called, it creates the window.
 *               - Subsequent times, it reuses that window.
 *               - Runs an X11 event loop waiting for the user to complete
 *                 or timeout, then returns the entered strings.
 *           - pam_conv takes the user input and returns success/failure.
 *       - xscreensaver_auth_finished is called to pop up a final dialog to
 *         present any error messages.
 *   - Exit with appropriate code.

/* Linux systems have an "out-of-memory killer" that will nuke random procs in
   low-memory situations.  You'd think it would pick the process using the
   most memory, but most of the time it seems to pick the process that would
   be most comically inconvenient, such as your screen locker, or crond.

   Since killing "xscreensaver" unlocks the screen... that would be bad.

   This program, "xscreensaver-auth", is the part of the XScreenSaver daemon
   that might need to be setuid for other reasons, so we handle the OOM killer
   here.  We could instead handle OOM in the "xscreensaver" program, but then
   that program would *also* need to be setuid.

   So instead, "xscreensaver-auth" sets OOM immunity on its *parent* process.
   That means that if you run it by hand, it will apply that immunity to the
   parent shell.  Maybe that's bad?  I think I don't care.

       Linux >= 2.6.11: echo -17   > /proc/$$/oom_adj
       Linux >= 2.6.37: echo -1000 > /proc/$$/oom_score_adj

   "An aircraft company discovered that it was cheaper to fly its planes with
   less fuel on board.  On rare occasions, however, the amount of fuel was
   insufficient, and the plane would crash.  In emergency cases, a passenger
   was selected and thrown out of the plane.  When necessary, the procedure
   was repeated."

       https://lwn.net/Articles/104179/

   The OOM killer preferentially kills processes whose *children* use a lot of
   memory, and processes that are niced.  So if a display mode uses a lot of
   memory, the OOM-killer is more likely to shoot down the XScreenSaver
   *daemon* than just that screenhack!

   To disable the OOM-killer entirely:

       echo 2 > /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory
       echo vm.overcommit_memory = 2 >> /etc/sysctl.conf
