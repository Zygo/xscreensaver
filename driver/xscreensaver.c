 * XScreenSaver Daemon, version 6.
 * ==========================================================================
 *
 * Having started its life in 1991, XScreenSaver acquired a lot of optional
 * features to allow it to detect user activity, lock the screen and
 * authenticate on systems as varied as VMS, SunOS, HPUX, SGI, and of course
 * that young upstart, Linux.  In such a heterogeneous environment, many
 * features that would have simplified things were not universally available.
 * Though I made an effort to follow a principle of minimal library usage in
 * the XScreenSaver daemon, as described in my 2004 article "On Toolkits"
 * <https://www.jwz.org/xscreensaver/toolkits.html>, there was still quite a
 * lot of code in the daemon, more than is strictly necessary when we consider
 * only modern, still-maintained operating systems.
 *
 * This 2021 refactor had one goal: to minimize the amount of code in which a
 * crash will cause the screen to unlock.  In service of that goal, the process
 * which holds the keyboard an mouse grabbed should:
 *
 *   -  Be as small as technically possible, for ease of auditing;
 *
 *   -  Link against as few libraries as possible, to bring in as little
 *      third-party code as possible;
 *
 *   -  Delegate other tasks to helper programs running in other processes,
 *      in such a way that if those other processes should crash, the grabs
 *      remain intact and the screen remains locked.
 *
 * In the XScreenSaver 6 design, the division of labor is as follows:
 *
 *  A)  "xscreensaver" -- This is the main screen saver daemon.  If this
 *      process crashes, the screen unlocks, so this is the one where
 *      minimizing the attack surface is critical.
 *
 *      -  It reads events using the XInput extension version 2, which is
 *         required.  This means that X11R7 is also required, which was
 *         released in 2009, and is ubiquitous as of 2021.
 *
 *      -  It links against only libX11 and libXi.
 *
 *      -  It maps no windows and renders no graphics or text.  It only
 *         acquires keyboard and mouse grabs, handles timer logic, and
 *         launches and manages several sub-processes.
 *
 *  B)  "xscreensaver-gfx" -- When the time comes for the screen to blank,
 *      this process is launched to fade out, black out every monitor on
 *      the system, launch graphics demos to render on those blanked screens,
 *      and cycle them from time to time.
 *
 *      -  If this program crashes, the screen does not unlock.  The keyboard
 *         and mouse remain grabbed by the "xscreensaver" process, which will
 *         re-launch this process as necessary.
 *
 *      -  If it does crash, the logged in user's desktop may be momentarily
 *         visible before it re-launches, but it will be impossible to interact
 *         with it.
 *
 *      -  This process must react to hot-swapping of monitors in order to
 *         keep the screen blanked and the desktop obscured, and manages the
 *         life cycle of the graphics demos, each running in their own
 *         sub-process of "xscreensaver-gfx".
 *
 *  C)  The graphics demos themselves.  Launched by "xscreensaver-gfx" to run
 *      on the windows provided, there is one of these processes for each
 *      screen.  These can use X11 or OpenGL, and have no impact on security;
 *      if it breaks, you can keep both pieces.
 *
 *  D)  "xscreensaver-auth" -- When the time comes to prompt the user for their
 *      password to unlock the screen, the "xscreensaver" daemon launches this
 *      process.  If it exits with a "success" error code, the screen unlocks,
 *      otherwise it does not.  This means that if it crashes, the screen
 *      remains locked.
 *
 *      -  It turns out that programs using the XInput 2 extension are able to
 *         snoop the keyboard even when the keyboard is grabbed by another
 *         process!  So that's how this program reads user input, even while
 *         the "xscreensaver" process has the keyboard grabbed.
 *
 *      -  This program runs PAM, or whatever other authorization mechanisms
 *         are configured.  On some systems, it may need to be setuid in order
 *         to read /etc/shadow, meaning it must disavow privileges after
 *         initialization but before connecting to the X server.
 *
 *      -  It gets to use libXft, so the fonts don't suck.
 *
 *      -  In theory, this program could be implemented using any GUI toolkit,
 *         and thus take advantage of input methods, on-screen keyboards,
 *         screen readers, etc.  Again, this is permissible because this
 *         program fails SAFE: if it crashes, the screen remains locked.
 *
 *  E)  "xscreensaver-systemd" -- This runs in the background and monitors
 *      requests on the systemd dbus.  This is how closing the laptop lid
 *      causes the screen to lock, and how video players request that blanking
 *      be inhibited.  This program invokes "xscreensaver-command" as needed
 *      to pass those requests along to "xscreensaver" via ClientMessages.
 *
 *
 * ==========================================================================
 * Ancient History
 * ==========================================================================
 *
 * As mentioned above, XScreenSaver version 6 (released in 2021) requires
 * the XInput 2 server extension for idle detection and password input.
 * In XScreenSaver 5 and earlier (1991 through 2020), idle-detection was
 * far more convoluted.  Basically, we selected input events on every window,
 * and noticed when new windows were created so that we could track them too.
 * Over the decades, there have also been three optional X11 server extensions
 * that were applicable to screen saving:
 *
 *  - XIdle
 *
 *    This extension provided a function to poll the user's idle time.
 *    It was simple and direct and worked great.  Therefore, it was
 *    removed from the X11 distribution in 1994, with the release of
 *    X11R6.  https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1419
 *
 *  - SGI SCREEN_SAVER
 *
 *    This extension sent two new events: "user is idle", and "user is no
 *    longer idle". It was simple and direct and worked great.  But as
 *    the name implies, it only ever worked on Silicon Graphics machines.
 *    SGI became irrelevant around 1998 and went out of business in 2009.
 *
 *  - MIT-SCREEN-SAVER
 *
 *    This extension still exists, but it is useless to us.  Since it still
 *    exists, people sometimes ask why XScreenSaver no longer makes use of it.
 *    The MIT-SCREEN-SAVER extension took the following approach:
 *
 *      - When the user is idle, immediately map full screen black windows
 *        on each screen.
 *
 *      - Inform the screen saver client that the screen is now black.
 *
 *      - When user activity occurs, unmap the windows and then inform the
 *        screen saver client.
 *
 *    The screen saver client was able to specify a few parameters of that
 *    window, like visual and depth, but that was all.
 *
 *    The extension was designed with the assumption that a screen saver would
 *    render onto the provided window.  However:
 *
 *      - OpenGL programs may require different visuals than 2D X11 programs,
 *        and you can't change the visual of a window after it has been
 *        created.
 *
 *      - The extension mapped one window per X11 "Screen", which, in this
 *        modern world, tend to span the entire virtual desktop; whereas
 *        XScreenSaver runs savers full screen on each *monitor* instead.
 *        In other words, it was incompatible with Xinerama / RANDR.
 *
 *      - Since this extension mapped its own full-screen black windows and
 *        informed us of that after the fact, it precluded "fade" and "unfade"
 *        animations from being implemented.
 *
 *      - Since it only told us when the user was idle or non-idle, it
 *        precluded the "hysteresis" option from being implemented (ignoring
 *        tiny mouse motions).
 *
 *    In summary, it created its windows too early, removed them too late,
 *    created windows of the wrong quantity and wrong shape, could not create
 *    them with the proper visuals, and delivered too little information about
 *    what caused the user activity.
 *
 *    Also, the MIT-SCREEN-SAVER extension was flaky, and using it at all led
 *    to frequent server crashes.  Worse, those server crashes were highly
 *    dependent on your particular video driver.
 *
 *     So that's why, even if the server supports the MIT-SCREEN-SAVER
 *     extension, we don't use it.
 *
 *     Some video players attempt to inhibit blanking during playback by
 *     calling XResetScreenSaver and/or XScreenSaverSuspend, which affect
 *     only the X server's *built-in* screen saver, and the window created
 *     by the MIT-SCREEN-SAVER extension.  To rely upon those calls alone
 *     and then call it a day would betray a willful ignorance of why the
 *     MIT-SCREEN-SAVER extension is a useless foundation upon which to
 *     build a screen saver or screen locker.
 *
 *     Fortunately, every modern video player and web browser also makes
 *     use of systemd / logind / dbus to request blanking inhibition, and
 *     we receive those requests via our systemd integration in
 *     xscreensaver-systemd (which see).

   that XScreenSaver is running, what the version number is, and it is where
   bidirectional ClientMessage communication takes place.  Since there are
   no "blanking" windows around at all when xscreensaver-gfx is not running,
   this window is needed.  We could have instead re-tooled xscreensaver-command
   to do all of its communication through the root window instead, but this 
   seemed easier.

  /* When should we allow blanking to proceed?  The current theory
     is that a keyboard grab is mandatory; a mouse grab is optional.

     - If we don't have a keyboard grab, then we won't be able to
       read a password to unlock, so the kbd grab is mandatory.
       (We can't conditionalize this on locked_p, because someone
       might run "xscreensaver-command -lock" at any time.)

     - If we don't have a mouse grab, then we might not see mouse
       clicks as a signal to unblank -- but we will still see kbd
       activity, so that's not a disaster.

     If the mouse grab failed with AlreadyGrabbed, then I *think*
     that means that we will still see the mouse events via XInput2.
     But if it failed with GrabFrozen, that means that the grabber
     used GrabModeSync, and we will only receive those mouse events
     as a replay after they release the grab, which doesn't help us.

     If the keyboard grab failed with AlreadyGrabbed rather than
     GrabFrozen then we may still get those keypresses -- but so will
     the program holding the grab, so that's unacceptable for our
     purpose of reading passwords.

     It has been suggested that we should allow blanking if locking
     is disabled, and we have a mouse grab but no keyboard grab.
     That would allow screen blanking (but not locking) while the gdm
     login screen had the keyboard grabbed, but one would have to use
     the mouse to unblank.  Keyboard characters would go to the gdm
     login field without unblanking.  I have not made this change
     because I'm not completely convinced it is a safe thing to do.

           ****************************************************************/

          /* XInput2 "raw" events bypass X11 grabs, but grabs take priority.
             If this process has the keyboard and mouse grabbed, it receives
             the following events:

               - X11 KeyPress, KeyRelease
               - X11 ButtonPress, ButtonRelease
               - X11 MotionNotify
               - XInput XI_RawButtonPress, XI_RawButtonRelease
               - XInput XI_RawMotion

             Note that button and motion events are doubly reported, but
             keyboard events are not.

             If this process does *not* have the keyboard and mouse grabbed,
             it receives the following events, regardless of the window in
             which they occur:

               - XInput XI_RawKeyPress, XI_RawKeyRelease
               - XInput XI_RawButtonPress, XI_RawButtonRelease
               - XInput XI_RawMotion

             But here's an irritating kink: though XInput2 generally allows
             snooping of everything, it respects GrabModeSync.  What this
             means is that if some other process has the keyboard grabbed with
             "Sync" instead of "Async", then this process will not see any of
             the events until that process releases its grab, and then the
             events come in late, all at once.  Verify this by running:

               test-xinput &
                  Note that keyboard and mouse events are detected.
               test-grab --mouse --mouse-async --kbd-async
                  Same.
               test-grab --mouse --mouse-sync --kbd-async
                  Keyboard events are detected.
                  No motion or button events until "test-grab" is killed.
               test-grab --mouse --mouse-async --kbd-sync
                  Vice versa.
