/* I don't believe what a sorry excuse for an operating system UNIX is!

   - I want to spawn a process.
   - I want to know it's pid so that I can kill it.
   - I would like to receive a message when it dies of natural causes.
   - I want the spawned process to have user-specified arguments.

   If shell metacharacters are present (wildcards, backquotes, etc), the
   only way to parse those arguments is to run a shell to do the parsing
   for you.

   And the only way to know the pid of the process is to fork() and exec()
   it in the spawned side of the fork.

   But if you're running a shell to parse your arguments, this gives you
   the pid of the *shell*, not the pid of the *process* that you're
   actually interested in, which is an *inferior* of the shell.  This also
   means that the SIGCHLD you get applies to the shell, not its inferior.
   (Why isn't that sufficient?  I don't remember any more, but it turns
   out that it isn't.)

   So, the only solution, when metacharacters are present, is to force the
   shell to exec() its inferior.  What a fucking hack!  We prepend "exec "
   to the command string, and hope it doesn't contain unquoted semicolons
   or ampersands (we don't search for them, because we don't want to
   prohibit their use in quoted strings (messages, for example) and parsing
   out the various quote characters is too much of a pain.)

   (Actually, Clint Wong <clint@jts.com> points out that process groups
   might be used to take care of this problem; this may be worth considering
   some day, except that, 1: this code works now, so why fix it, and 2: from
   what I've seen in Emacs, dealing with process groups isn't especially
   portable.)
