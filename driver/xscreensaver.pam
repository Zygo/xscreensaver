#%PAM-1.0
# Configuration used by XScreenSaver to unlock the screen.

# Use the same mechanisms and restrictions as for logging in on the console:

auth     include login
account  include login
password include login
session  include login

# Do this to unlock GNOME Keyring and KDE Wallet when the screen unlocks:

# auth   optional pam_gnome_keyring.so 
# auth   optional pam_kwallet5.so
