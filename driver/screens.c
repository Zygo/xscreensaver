/*   There are a bunch of different mechanisms for multiple monitors
 *   available in X.  XScreenSaver needs to care about this for two reasons:
 *   first, to ensure that all visible areas go black; and second, so that
 *   the windows of screen savers exactly fill the glass of each monitor
 *   (instead of one saver spanning multiple monitors, or a monitor
 *   displaying only a sub-rectangle of the screen saver.)
 *
 *   1) Multi-screen:
 *
 *      This is the original way.  Each monitor gets its own display number.
 *      ":0.0" is the first one, ":0.1" is the next, and so on.  The value
 *      of $DISPLAY determines which screen windows open on by default.  A
 *      single app can open windows on multiple screens with the same
 *      display connection, but windows cannot be moved from one screen to
 *      another.  The mouse can be moved from one screen to another, though.
 *      Screens may be different depths (e.g., one can be TrueColor and one
 *      can be PseudoColor.)  Screens cannot be resized or moved without
 *      restarting X.  Sometimes this mode is referred to as "ZaphodHeads".
 *
 *      Everyone hates this way of doing things because of the inability to
 *      move a window from one screen to another without restarting the
 *      application.
 *
 *   2) Xinerama:
 *
 *      There is a single giant root window that spans all the monitors.
 *      All monitors are the same depth, and windows can be moved around.
 *      Applications can learn which rectangles are actually visible on
 *      monitors by querying the Xinerama server extension.  (If you don't
 *      do that, you end up with dialog boxes that try to appear in the
 *      middle of the screen actually spanning the gap between two
 *      monitors.)
 *
 *      Xinerama didn't work with DRI, which means that Xinerama precluded
 *      hardware acceleration in OpenGL programs.  Also, screens couldn't
 *      be resized or moved without restarting X.
 *
 *   3) Vidmode Viewports:
 *
 *      No longer supported as of XScreenSaver 6.
 *
 *      With this extension, the root window could be bigger than the
 *      monitor.  Moving the mouse near the edges of the screen would
 *      scroll around, like a pan-and-scan movie.  There was also a
 *      hot-key for changing the monitor's resolution (zooming in/out).
 *
 *      Trying to combine this with Xinerama crashed the server, so you
 *      could ONLY use this if you had only a single screen, or were in
 *      old multi-screen mode.
 *
 *      Also, half the time it didn't work at all: it tended to lie about
 *      the size of the rectangle in use.
 *
 *   4) RANDR 1.0:
 *
 *      The first version of the "Resize and Rotate" extension let you
 *      change the resolution of a screen on the fly.  The root window
 *      would actually resize.  However, it was also incompatible with
 *      Xinerama (did it crash, or just do nothing? I can't remember) so
 *      you needed to be in single-screen or old multi-screen mode.  I
 *      believe RANDR could co-exist with Vidmode Viewports, but I'm not
 *      sure.
 *
 *   5) RANDR 1.2:
 *
 *      Finally, RANDR added the functionality of Xinerama, plus some.
 *      Each X screen (in the sense of #1, "multi-screen") can have a
 *      number of sub-rectangles that are displayed on monitors, and each
 *      of those sub-rectangles can be displayed on more than one monitor.
 *      So it's possible (I think) to have a hybrid of multi-screen and
 *      Xinerama (e.g., to have two monitors running in one depth, and
 *      three monitors running in another?)  Typically though, there will
 *      be a single X screen with one giant root window underlying the
 *      rectangles of multiple monitors.  Also everything is dynamic:
 *      monitors can be added, removed, and resized at runtime, with
 *      notification events.
 *
 *      RANDR rectangles can overlap, meaning one monitor can mirror
 *      another, or show a sub-rectangle of another, or just overlap in
 *      strange ways.  The proper way to respond to weird layouts is... not
 *      always obvious.
 *
 *      Also sometimes RANDR says stupid shit like, "You have one screen,
 *      and it has no available sizes or orientations."
 *
 *      Sometimes RANDR and Xinerama report the same info, and sometimes
 *      not, so we look at both and see which looks most plausible.
 *
 *      Also, Nvidia fucked it up: their drivers that were popular in 2008,
 *      when running in "TwinView" mode, reported correct sizes via
 *      Xinerama, but reported one giant screen via RANDR.  Nvidia's
 *      response was, "We don't support RANDR, use Xinerama instead", which
 *      is another reason that XScreenSaver historically had to query both
 *      extensions and make a guess.  Maybe this is no longer necessary.

/*   From: Aaron Plattner <aplattner@nvidia.com>
     Date: August 7, 2008 10:21:25 AM PDT
     To: linux-bugs@nvidia.com

     The NVIDIA X driver does not yet support RandR 1.2.  The X server has
     a compatibility layer in it that allows RandR 1.2 clients to talk to
     RandR 1.1 drivers through an RandR 1.2 pseudo-output called "default".
     This reports the total combined resolution of the TwinView display,
     since it doesn't have any visibility into TwinView metamodes.  There
     is no way for the driver to prevent the server from turning on this
     compatibility layer.

     The intention is for X client applications to continue to use the
     Xinerama extension to query the screen geometry.  RandR 1.2 reports
     its own Xinerama info for this purpose.  I would recommend against
     modifying xscreensaver to try to get this information from RandR.
