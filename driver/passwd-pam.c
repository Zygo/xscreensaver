/* PAM sucks in that there is no way to tell whether a particular service is
   configured at all.  That is, there is no way to tell the difference between
   "authentication of the FOO service is not allowed" and "the user typed the
   wrong password."

   On RedHat 5.1 systems, if a service name is not known, it defaults to being
   not allowed (because the fallback service, /etc/pam.d/other, is set to
   `pam_deny'.)

   On Solaris 2.6 systems, unknown services default to authenticating normally.

   So, we require that an "xscreensaver" PAM service exist.  This has a bad
   failure mode, however: if that service doesn't exist, then XScreenSaver
   will lock the screen, but is unable to unlock.  (With the non-PAM password
   code, XScreenSaver can refuse to lock, because it is able to determine up
   front that it was unable to retrieve the password info.)

   At startup, we check for the existence of /etc/pam.d/xscreensaver or
   /etc/pam.conf, and if those don't exist, we print a warning that PAM is
   probably not configured properly.  This isn't *necessarily* correct, since
   those files are not a part of PAM's C API, but it's how real-world systems
   actually work.

   Also note that FreeBSD's PAM configuration requires the calling process to
   be running as root during the *entire* interactive PAM conversation: it
   can't ever disavow privileges.  Whereas Linux's PAM configurations use a
   setuid helper within the PAM stack so that a non-root process can still
   authenticate, as is right and proper.  Consequently, PAM does not work with
   XScreenSaver on FreeBSD by default.  Dear FreeBSD, get your shit together.

   I am told that only *some* of the FreeBSD PAM modules have this bug, e.g.,
   "pam_unix" fails, but "pam_winbind" works.  So this problem is demonstrably
   fixable entirely within the PAM stack, and that's where it should be fixed.
