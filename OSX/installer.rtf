This will install all of the screen savers system-wide. 
If you prefer, you can instead install them one at a time by opening 
the \i "Screen Savers" \i0 folder in this disk image and double-clicking 
on only the ones that you want.\
\
The full installation will take around 160 MB.\
\
\b Installation will take several minutes, and the progress bar will not 
move for most of that time. Just wait it out! \b0 \
