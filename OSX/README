This directory contains the MacOS-specific code for building a Cocoa
version of xscreensaver without using X11.

To build it, just type "make", or use the included XCode project.  The
executables will show up in the "build/Release/" and/or "build/Debug/"
directories.

If you build using anything later than Xcode 5.0.2, the resultant savers
will require MacOS 10.7 or later.  To support 10.4 through 10.6, you must
use Xcode 5.0.2 or earlier.

This is how you add a new screen saver to the Xcode project. It's a
ridiculously long list of steps!

  1: Duplicate a target (Dangerball for GL, or Attraction for X11).
  2: Rename it, and drag it to the right spot in the list.
  3: Delete the dangerball.c and dangerball.xml files from Build Phases.
  4: Delete the "DangerBall copy-Info.plist" file that got created.
  5: Delete the "DangerBall copy-Info.plist" from the Build Settings too.
  6: Manage Schemes, rename "DangerBall Copy".
  7: Move to the right place in the list.
  8. Scheme / Profile / Info: Executable: SaverTester.app.
     Scheme / Run / Info: Executable: SaverTester.app.
  9: Scheme / Run / Arguments: set SELECTED_SAVER environment variable.
 10: File / Add Files / the new .c and .xml.
 11: Re-order them in the file list. This will bring up an Options dialog.
     Add To Targets: the new target, and "XScreenSaver-iOS".
 12: The files might not have moved. This means Xcode is gonna crash soon.
     It will repair itself after.
 13: In target "All Savers (OpenGL)" add the new target as Build Phases /
     Target Dependency.
 14: In target "XScreenSaver-iOS", reorder new files in Build Phases /
     "Copy" and "Compile", since they showed up in a random place.
 15: In target "XScreenSaver-iOS", add "-DUSE_GL" to the new file's options.
 16: Put a 200x150 screen shot in ~/www/xscreensaver/screenshots/
 17: ln -s ../../src/xscreensaver/OSX/build/Debug/NEW.saver \
           ~/Library/Screen\ Savers/
 18: git add xscreensaver.xcodeproj/xcuserdata/*/xcschemes/*.xcscheme
 19: Don't forget to create a man page from the XML with xml2man.pl,
     and update Makefile.in.
 20: Make a video: -record-animation 3600 -geom 1920x1080+128+64
     ./upload-video.pl NAME
