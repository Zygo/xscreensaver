     async, so if that dialog has popped up, the *current* screen grab will
     still fail.

     To reset answers given to that dialog: "tccutil reset ScreenCapture".

     Sadly, this is not working at all.  If the .saver bundle is launched by
     SaverTester, the dialog is triggered on behalf of SaverTester, but it is
     not triggered on behalf of ScreenSaverEngine or System Preferences.

     Manually dragging "/System/Library/Frameworks/ScreenSaver.framework/
     PlugIns/legacyScreenSaver.appex" onto the "System Preferences / Security /
     Privacy / Screen Recording" list makes screen grabbing work, but that's
     a lot to ask of the end user.  And, oddly, after dragging it there, it
     does not appear in the list.
