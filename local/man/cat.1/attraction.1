       The _a_t_t_r_a_c_t_i_o_n  program  has  several  visually  different
       modes of operation, all of which are based on the interac-
       tions of a set of control points which attract each  other
       up  to  a  certain  distance, and then begin to repel each
       other.  The attraction/repulsion is  proportional  to  the
       distance between any two particles.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       _a_t_t_r_a_c_t_i_o_n accepts the following options:

       --wwiinnddooww Draw  on  a  newly-created  window.   This  is the
               default.

       --rroooott   Draw on the root window.

       --mmoonnoo   If  on  a  color  display,  pretend  we're  on   a
               monochrome display.

       --iinnssttaallll
               Install a private colormap for the window.

       --vviissuuaall _v_i_s_u_a_l
               Specify which visual to use.  Legal values are the
               name of a visual class, or the id number  (decimal
               or hex) of a specific visual.

       --ppooiinnttss iinntteeggeerr
               How  many  control  points should be used, or 0 to
               select the number randomly.  Default 0.  Between 3
               and 15 works best.

       --tthhrreesshhoolldd iinntteeggeerr
               The  distance  (in  pixels)  from each particle at
               which  the  attractive  force  becomes  repulsive.
               Default 100.

               In _b_a_l_l_s mode (the default) the control points are
               drawn as filled circles.  The larger  the  circle,

               the more massive the particle.

               In _l_i_n_e_s mode, the control points are connected by
               straight lines; the effect is something like  _q_i_x.

               In _p_o_l_y_g_o_n_s mode, the control points are connected
               by straight lines, and filled in.   This  is  most
               interesting in color.

               In  _s_p_l_i_n_e_s  mode, a closed spline is interpolated
               from the control points.

               In _f_i_l_l_e_d_-_s_p_l_i_n_e_s mode, the splines are filled  in
               instead of being outlines.  This is most interest-
               ing in color.

               In _t_a_i_l_s mode, the path which each  particle  fol-
               lows  is  indicated  by  a  worm-like trail, whose
               length is controlled by the _s_e_g_m_e_n_t_s parameter.

       --ssiizzee iinntteeggeerr
               The size of the balls in pixels, or 0, meaning  to
               select  the sizes randomly (the default.)  If this
               is specified, then all  balls  will  be  the  same
               size.   This  option  has  an effect in all modes,
               since the ``size'' of  the  balls  controls  their
               mass.

       --sseeggmmeennttss iinntteeggeerr
               If  in  _l_i_n_e_s  or  _p_o_l_y_g_o_n_s mode, how many sets of
               line segments or polygons should be drawn. Default
               100.   This  has no effect in _b_a_l_l_s mode.  If _s_e_g_-
               _m_e_n_t_s is 0, then no segments will ever  be  erased
               (this is only useful in color.)

       --ddeellaayy mmiiccrroosseeccoonnddss
               How  much  of a delay should be introduced between
               steps of the animation.  Default 10000,  or  about
               0.01 seconds.

       --ccoolloorr--sshhiifftt iinntt
               If  on a color display, the color of the line seg-
               ments or polygons will  cycle  through  the  color
               map.   This specifies how many lines will be drawn
               before a new color is chosen.  (When a small  num-
               ber of colors are available, increasing this value
               will  yield  smoother  transitions.)   Default  3.
               This has no effect in _b_a_l_l_s mode.

       --rraaddiiuuss The  size  in  pixels  of  the circle on which the
               points are initially positioned.  The  default  is
               slightly smaller than the size of the window.

       --ggllooww   This  is consulted only in _b_a_l_l_s mode.  If this is

               specified, then the saturation of  the  colors  of
               the  points  will  vary according to their current
               acceleration.  This has the effect that the  balls
               flare  brighter  when  they  are  reacting to each
               other most strongly.

               In _g_l_o_w mode, all of the balls will be  drawn  the
               same (random) color, modulo the saturation shifts.
               In non-glow mode, the balls will each be drawn  in
               a random color that doesn't change.

       --nnooggllooww Don't do ``glowing.''  This is the default.

       --vvxx ppiixxeellss

       --vvyy ppiixxeellss
               Initial velocity of the balls.  This has no effect
               in --oorrbbiitt mode.

       --oorrbbiitt  Make the initial force on each ball be  tangential
               to  the circle on which they are initially placed,
               with the right velocity  to  hold  them  in  orbit
               about  each other.  After a while, roundoff errors
               will cause the orbit to decay.

       --vvmmuulltt ffllooaatt
               In orbit mode, the initial velocity of  the  balls
               is  multiplied  by this; a number less than 1 will
               make the balls pull closer together, and a  larger
               number  will make them move apart.  The default is
               0.9, meaning a slight inward pull.

       --vviissccoossiittyy ffllooaatt
               This sets the viscosity of the hypothetical  fluid
               through which the control points move; the default
               is 1, meaning no resistance.  Values higher than 1
               aren't   interesting;   lower  values  cause  less
               motion.

               One interesting thing to try is

                    attraction -viscosity 0.8 -points 75 \
                      -mouse -geometry =500x500

               Give it a few seconds to settle down into a stable
               clump,  and then move the mouse through it to make
               "waves".

       --mmoouussee  This will cause the mouse to be considered a  con-
               trol  point;  it  will  not  be drawn, but it will
               influence the other points, so you  can  wave  the
               mouse and influence the images being created.
