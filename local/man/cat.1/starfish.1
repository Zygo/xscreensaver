       The  _s_t_a_r_f_i_s_h  program  draws  radially symmetric objects,
       which expand, contract, rotate, and turn inside  out.   It
       uses  these  shapes  to lay down a field of smooth colors,
       and then rotates the colormap.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       _s_t_a_r_f_i_s_h accepts the following options:

       --wwiinnddooww Draw on  a  newly-created  window.   This  is  the
               default.

       --rroooott   Draw on the root window.

       --mmoonnoo   If   on  a  color  display,  pretend  we're  on  a
               monochrome display.

       --iinnssttaallll
               Install a private colormap for the window.

       --vviissuuaall _v_i_s_u_a_l
               Specify which visual to use.  Legal values are the
               name  of a visual class, or the id number (decimal
               or hex) of a specific visual.

       --ddeellaayy _m_i_c_r_o_s_e_c_o_n_d_s
               How much of a delay should be  introduced  between
               steps  of  the animation.  Default 10000, or about
               1/100th second.

       --ccyyccllee--ddeellaayy _m_i_c_r_o_s_e_c_o_n_d_s
               How long to wait between shifing the  colormap  by
               one step.  Default 100000, or about 1/10th second.

       --tthhiicckknneessss _p_i_x_e_l_s
               How wide each color band should  be.   Default  0,
               meaning random (the chosen value will be between 0
               and 15.)

       --rroottaattiioonn _d_e_g_r_e_e_s
               How quickly the  objects  should  rotate  at  each
               step.  Default 0, meaning random (the chosen value

               will be between 0 and 12 degrees.)

       --ccoolloorrss _i_n_t
               How many colors to use.  Default  200.   The  more
               colors,  the smoother the transitions will be, and
               the nicer the resultant images.

       --ccyyccllee

       --nnoo--ccyyccllee
               Whether to do colormap cycling.  Default true.

       --dduurraattiioonn _s_e_c_o_n_d_s
               How long to  run  before  choosing  a  new  shape.
               Default 30 seconds.

       --ddeellaayy22 _s_e_c_o_n_d_s
               When  _d_u_r_a_t_i_o_n  expires,  how  long to wait before
               starting a new run.  Default 5 seconds.

       --bblloobb

       --nnoo--bblloobb
               If _b_l_o_b option is specified, then the  raw  shapes
               will be shown, instead of a field of colors gener-
               ated from them.
