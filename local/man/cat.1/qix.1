       The  _q_i_x  program bounces a series of line segments around
       its window.  This is truly the swiss army chainsaw of  qix
       programs.   If  you know of one with more display modes, I
       want to know about it.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       _q_i_x accepts the following options:

       --wwiinnddooww Draw on  a  newly-created  window.   This  is  the
               default.

       --rroooott   Draw on the root window.

       --mmoonnoo   If   on  a  color  display,  pretend  we're  on  a
               monochrome display.

       --iinnssttaallll
               Install a private colormap for the window.

       --vviissuuaall _v_i_s_u_a_l
               Specify which visual to use.  Legal values are the
               name  of a visual class, or the id number (decimal
               or hex) of a specific visual.

       --sseeggmmeennttss _i_n_t_e_g_e_r
               How many line segments should be  drawn.   Default
               50.

       --sspprreeaadd _i_n_t_e_g_e_r
               How  far apart the endpoints of one segment should
               be from the next.  Default 8.

       --ssiizzee _i_n_t_e_g_e_r
               The maximum distance one endpoint of a segment  is
               allowed  to  be from the opposite end of that seg-
               ment.  Default 0, meaning unlimited.

       --ccoouunntt _i_n_t_e_g_e_r
               How many qixes to draw.  Default 1.

XScreenSaver(1)                                   XScreenSaver(1)


       --ccoolloorr--sshhiifftt _d_e_g_r_e_e_s
               If on a color display, the color of the line  seg-
               ments will cycle through the spectrum.  This spec-
               ifies how far the hue of each  segment  should  be
               from  the  next,  in  degrees  on  the  HSV wheel.
               Default 3.

       --ddeellaayy _m_i_c_r_o_s_e_c_o_n_d_s
               How much of a delay should be  introduced  between
               steps  of  the animation.  Default 25000, or about
               0.025 seconds.

       --rraannddoomm The _q_i_x will wander around  the  screen  semi-ran-
               domly.  This is the default.

       --lliinneeaarr The  opposite  of  _-_r_a_n_d_o_m: the _q_i_x will travel in
               straight lines until it reaches a wall,  and  then
               it will bounce.

       --ssoolliidd  If  this  is  specified, then the area between the
               line segments will be filled in with the appropri-
               ate  color,  instead  of the _q_i_x simply being com-
               posed  of  one-pixel-wide  line  segments.    This
               option looks really good in color.

       --hhoollllooww The opposite of _-_s_o_l_i_d; this is the default.

       --xxoorr    If  this  is  specified, then qix segments will be
               drawn and erased with xor, instead of being  drawn
               in  some color and erased in the background color.
               This implies _-_m_o_n_o, in that only two colors can be
               used.

       --ttrraannssppaarreenntt
               If  this  is specified, and _-_c_o_u_n_t is greater than
               1, then each qix will be drawn in one  color,  and
               when they overlap, the colors will be mixed.  This
               only works on PPsseeuuddooCCoolloorr  displays.   This  looks
               best in conjuction with _-_s_o_l_i_d.

       --nnoonn--ttrraannssppaarreenntt
               Turns off _-_t_r_a_n_s_p_a_r_e_n_t.

       --aaddddiittiivvee
               If  _-_t_r_a_n_s_p_a_r_e_n_t  is  specified,  then this option
               means that the colors will be mixed using an addi-
               tive  color  model, as if the qixes were projected
               light.  This is the default.

       --ssuubbttrraaccttiivvee
               If _-_t_r_a_n_s_p_a_r_e_n_t is  specified,  then  this  option
               means  that  the colors will be mixed using a sub-
               tractive  color  model,  as  if  the  qixes   were
               translucent filters.

       --ppoollyy _i_n_t
               How  many  vertices each qix-line should have: the
               default is 2, meaning  the  traditional  qix  line
               shape.  Three will yield triangles, and so on.

       --ggrraavviittyy

       --nnoo--ggrraavviittyy
               Whether  there should be downward attraction.  For
               example, the options --ggrraavviittyy  --lliinneeaarr  will  make
               everything move in nice smooth parabolas.  Gravity
               is off by default.

EENNVVIIRROONNMMEENNTT
       DDIISSPPLLAAYY to get the default host and display number.

       XXEENNVVIIRROONNMMEENNTT
               to get the name of a resource file that  overrides
               the  global  resources stored in the RESOURCE_MAN-
               AGER property.
