       The _g_o_o_p program draws a simulation of bubbles  in  layers
       of overlapping multicolored translucent fluid.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       _g_o_o_p accepts the following options:

       --wwiinnddooww Draw  on  a  newly-created  window.   This  is the
               default.

       --rroooott   Draw on the root window.

       --mmoonnoo   If  on  a  color  display,  pretend  we're  on   a
               monochrome display.

       --iinnssttaallll
               Install a private colormap for the window.

       --vviissuuaall _v_i_s_u_a_l
               Specify which visual to use.  Legal values are the
               name of a visual class, or the id number  (decimal
               or hex) of a specific visual.

       --ccoouunntt _i_n_t_e_g_e_r
               How many bubbles to draw per layer.  Default: ran-
               dom.

       --llaayyeerrss _i_n_t_e_g_e_r
               How many layers to draw.  Default:  random,  based
               on screen depth.

       --ddeellaayy _m_i_c_r_o_s_e_c_o_n_d_s
               How  much  of a delay should be introduced between
               steps of the animation.  Default 100000, or  about
               1/10th second.

       --ttrraannssppaarreenntt
               If _-_l_a_y_e_r_s is greater than 1, then each layer will
               be drawn in one color, and when they overlap,  the
               colors will be mixed. This is the default.

       --nnoonn--ttrraannssppaarreenntt
               Turns off _-_t_r_a_n_s_p_a_r_e_n_t.

       --aaddddiittiivvee
               If  _-_t_r_a_n_s_p_a_r_e_n_t  is  specified,  then this option
               means that the colors will be mixed using an addi-
               tive  color  model, as if the blobs were projected
               light.  This is the default.

       --ssuubbttrraaccttiivvee
               If _-_t_r_a_n_s_p_a_r_e_n_t is  specified,  then  this  option
               means  that  the colors will be mixed using a sub-
               tractive  color  model,  as  if  the  blobs   were
               translucent filters.

       --xxoorr    Draw with xor instead of the other color tricks.
