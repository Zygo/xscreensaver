Here is a build config for Debian that packages XScreenSaver the correct way.

The way Debian packages XScreenSaver is an absolute atrocity: it divides it
into half a dozen sub-packages, ensuring that some users will accidentally
end up with a half-installed, nonfunctional installation of XScreenSaver.
XScreenSaver is a single software package.  That is how I wrote it, how I
test it, and how it should be distributed.  I have been asking them to
change this for years and they refuse.

To build a .deb file, do this in the root of the xscreensaver tree:

	make tar
	make deb

Files will appear in debian/build/
