<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<B>xlock</B>

locks the X server till the user enters their password at the keyboard.
While
<B>xlock</B>

is running,
all new server connections are refused.
The screen saver is disabled.
The mouse cursor is turned off.
The screen is blanked and a changing pattern is put on the screen.
If a key or a mouse button is pressed then the user is prompted for the
password of the user who started
<B>xlock</B>.

<P>
If the correct password is typed, then the screen is unlocked and the X
server is restored.  When typing the password Control-U and Control-H are
active as kill and erase respectively.  To return to the locked screen,
click in the small icon version of the changing pattern.
<P>
In the lower part of the password screen a message is displayed.  This
message is taken from the first file of the following that exists:
$HOME/.xlockmessage, $HOME/.plan, or $HOME/.signature.
<P>
On systems which support new BSD style authentication, the password
may be prefixed by an authentication style followed by a colon
(i.e. &quot;style:password&quot;).  See the <A HREF="http:/cgi-bin/man2html?man5/login.conf.5">login.conf</A>(5) for more information
on authentication styles.
<P>
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NOTE ON ETIQUETTE</H2>

<I>Xlock</I>

should not be used on public terminals when there is a high demand for them.
<P>
If you find a public terminal that has been locked by another user and
there are no other terminals available, and the terminal appears to have
been left idle for a while (normally more than 15 minutes), it is fair to
try to reset the session in some manner.

blank mode, it is important to set this to some small number of seconds,
because the keyboard and mouse are only checked after each delay, so you
cannot set the delay too high, but a delay of zero would needlessly
consume cpu checking for mouse and keyboard input in a tight loop, since
blank mode has no work to do.

run
<B>xlock</B>

locally.  If you lock someone else's workstation, they will have to know
<B>your</B>

password to unlock it.  Using
<I>+remote</I>

overrides any resource derived values for
<I>remote</I>

and prevents
<B>xlock</B>

from being used to lock other X11 servers.  (Use `+' instead of `-' to
override resources for other options that can take the `+' modifier
similarly.)
<DT><B>-/+mono</B>

<DD>
The
<I>mono</I>

option causes
<B>xlock</B>

to display monochrome, (black and white) pixels rather than the default
colored ones on color displays.
<DT><B>-/+allowaccess</B>

<DD>
This option is required for servers which do not allow clients to modify
the host access control list.  It is also useful if you need to run x
clients on a server which is locked for some reason...  When
<I>allowaccess</I>

is true, the X11 server is left open for clients to attach and thus
lowers the inherent security of this lock screen.  A side effect of using
this option is that if
<B>xlock</B>

is killed -KILL, the access control list is not lost.
<DT><B>-/+allowroot</B>

<DD>
The
<I>allowroot</I>

option allows the root password to unlock the server as well as the user
who started
<B>xlock</B>.

May not be able to turn this on and off depending on your system and how
<B>xlock</B>

was configured.
<DT><B>-/+debug</B>

<DD>
Allows
<B>xlock</B>

to be debugged by doing all but locking the screen.
<DT><B>-/+echokeys</B>

<DD>
The
<I>echokeys</I>

option causes
<B>xlock</B>

to echo '?' characters for each key typed into the password prompt.
Some consider this a security risk, so the default is to not echo
anything. 
<DT><B>-/+enablesaver</B>

<DD>
By default
<B>xlock</B>

will disable the normal X server's screen saver since
it is in effect a replacement for it.  Since it is possible to set delay
parameters long enough to cause phosphor burn on some displays, this
option will turn back on the default screen saver which is very careful
to keep most of the screen black.
<DT><B>-/+resetsaver</B>

<DD>
By default
<B>xlock</B>

will call XResetScreenSaver.  This may be undesirable with DPMS monitors.
<DT><B>-/+grabmouse</B>

<DD>
The
<I>grabmouse</I>

option causes
<B>xlock</B>

to grab the mouse and keyboard, this is the default.
<B>xlock</B>

can not lock the screen without this.
<DT><B>-/+grabserver</B>

<DD>
The
<I>grabserver</I>

option causes
<B>xlock</B>

to grab the server.  This is not usually needed but some unsecure X servers
can be defeated without this.
<DT><B>-/+install</B>

<DD>
Allows
<B>xlock</B>

to install its own colormap if
<B>xlock</B>

runs out of colors.
May not work on with some window managers (fvwm) and does not work with
the -inroot option.
<DT><B>-/+mousemotion</B>

<DD>
Allows you to turn on and off the sensitivity to the mouse to bring up
the password window.
<DT><B>-/+sound</B>

<DD>
Allows you to turn on and off sound if installed with the capability.
<DT><B>-/+timeelapsed</B>

<DD>
Allows you to find out how long a machine is locked so you can complain
to an administrator that someone is hogging a machine.
<DT><B>-/+usefirst</B>

<DD>
The
<I>usefirst</I>

option causes
<B>xlock</B>

to use the keystroke which got you to the password screen as the first
character in the password.  The default is to ignore the first key
pressed.
<DT><B>-/+verbose</B>

<DD>
Verbose mode, tells what options it is going to use.
<DT><B>-nice</B><I>&nbsp;nicelevel</I>

<DD>
The
<I>nice</I>

option sets system nicelevel of the
<B>xlock</B>

process to
<I>nicelevel .</I>

<DT><B>-lockdelay</B><I>&nbsp;seconds</I>

<DD>
The
<I>lockdelay</I>

option sets the number of
<I>seconds</I>

before the screen needs a password to be unlocked.  Good for use with
an autolocking mechanism like <A HREF="http:/cgi-bin/man2html?man1/xautolock.1">xautolock</A>(1).
<DT><B>-timeout</B><I>&nbsp;seconds</I>

<DD>
The
<I>timeout</I>

option sets the number of
<I>seconds</I>

before the password screen will time out.
<DT><B>-font</B><I>&nbsp;fontname</I>

<DD>
The
<I>font</I>

option sets the font to be used on the prompt screen.
<DT><B>-msgfont</B><I>&nbsp;fontname</I>

<DD>
option sets the font to be used for the message that is displayed in
the lower part of the password screen.
<DT><B>-fg</B><I>&nbsp;color</I>

<DD>
The
<I>fg</I>

option sets the color of the text on the password screen to
<I>color .</I>

<DT><B>-bg</B><I>&nbsp;color</I>

<DD>
The
<I>bg</I>

option sets the color of the background on the password screen to
<I>color .</I>

<DT><B>-foreground</B><I>&nbsp;color</I>

<DD>
The
<I>foreground</I>

option sets the color of the text on the password screen to
<I>color .</I>

<DT><B>-background</B><I>&nbsp;color</I>

<DD>
The
<I>background</I>

option sets the color of the background on the password screen to
<I>color .</I>

<DT><B>-username</B><I>&nbsp;string</I>

<DD>
Text
<I>string</I>

<DT><B>-info</B><I>&nbsp;string</I>

<DD>
Text
<I>string</I>

is an informational message to tell the user what to do, defaults to
&quot;Enter password to unlock; select icon to lock.&quot;.
<DT><B>-validate</B><I>&nbsp;string</I>

<DD>
Text
<I>string</I>

is a message shown while validating the password, defaults to
&quot;Validating login...&quot;
<DT><B>-invalid</B><I>&nbsp;string</I>

<DD>
Text
<I>string</I>

is a message shown when password is invalid, defaults to
&quot;Invalid login.&quot;
<DT><B>-geometry</B><I>&nbsp;geom</I>

<DD>
The
<I>geometry</I>

option sets
<I>geom</I>

the size and offset of the lock window (normally the entire screen).
The entire screen format is still used for entering the password.  The
purpose is to see the screen even though it is locked.  This should be
used with caution since many of the modes will fail if the windows
are far from square or are too small (size must be greater than 0x0).
This should also be used with -enablesaver to protect screen from
phosphor burn.
<DT><B>-icongeometry</B><I>&nbsp;geom</I>

<DD>
The
<I>icongeometry</I>

option sets
<I>geom</I>

the size of the iconic screen (normally 64x64) seen when entering the
password.  This should be used with caution since many of the modes will
fail if the windows are far from square or are too small (size must be
greater than 0x0).  The greatest size is 256x256.  There should be some
limit so users could see who has locked the screen.  Position
information of icon is ignored.
<DT><B>-glgeometry</B><I>&nbsp;geom</I>

<DD>
The
<I>glgeometry</I>

option sets
<I>geom</I>

the size of the screen for gl modes.  Not normally available or needed.
<DT><B>-/+fullrandom</B>

Turn on/off randomness options within modes.  Not implemented on all
mode options.
<DT><B>-/+wireframe</B>

<DD>
Turn on/off wireframe, available on gears, sproingies and superquadrics.
Other modes should use this in the future as well (e.g. daisy, life3d,
triangle).
<DT><B>-/+use3d</B>

<DD>
Turn on/off 3d view, available on bouboule, pyro, star, and worm.
<DT><B>-delta3d</B><I>&nbsp;value</I>

<DT><B>-both3d</B><I>&nbsp;color</I>

<DD>
Color used for overlapping images for left and right eye in 3d mode.
<DT><B>-program</B><I>&nbsp;programname</I>

<DD>
The
<I>program</I>

option sets the program to be used as the fortune generator.  Currently
used only for marquee and nose modes.
<DT><B>-messagesfile</B><I>&nbsp;formatted-filename</I>

<DD>
The
<I>messagesfile</I>

option sets the file to be used as the fortune generator.  The first
entry is the number of fortunes, the next line contains the first fortune.
Fortunes begin with a &quot;%%&quot; on a line by itself.  Currently used only for
marquee and nose modes.  If one exists, it takes precedence over the
fortune program.
<DT><B>-messagefile</B><I>&nbsp;filename</I>

<DD>
The
<I>messagefile</I>

option sets the file where the contents are the message.  Currently
used only for marquee and nose modes.  If one exists, it takes
precedence over the fortune program and messagesfile.
<DT><B>-message</B><I>&nbsp;textstring</I>

<DD>
The
<I>message</I>

option sets the message.  Currently used only for marquee and nose modes.
If one exists, it takes precedence over the fortune program,
messagesfile and messagefile.
<DT><B>-mfont</B><I>&nbsp;mode-fontname</I>

<DD>
The
<I>mfont</I>

option sets the font to be used in the mode.  Currently used only for
marquee and nose modes.
<DT><B>-imagefile</B><I>&nbsp;filename</I>

<DD>
The
<I>imagefile</I>

option sets the ras or xpm file to be displayed with flag, image, life,
life1d, maze, or puzzle mode.
<DT><B>-neighbors</B><I>&nbsp;num</I>

<DD>
The
<I>neighbors </I>

option sets the number of neighbors of a cell to 3, 4, 6, 9 (may not have
real mathematical meaning), or 12 for several automata modes.  Setting it to
0 typically randomizes this, except in life where it is set to 8.
<DT><B>-/+mouse</B>

<H2>**WARNING**</H2>

<B>xlock</B>

can appear to hang if it is competing with a high-priority process for
the CPU. For example, if
<B>xlock</B>

is started after a process with 'nice -20'
(high priority),
<B>xlock</B>

will take  considerable amount of time to respond.
<P>
<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SHADOW PASSWORDS</H2>

If the machine is using a shadow password system, then
<B>xlock</B>

may not be set up to get the real password and so must be given one
of its own. This can be either on the command line, via the
<B>-cpasswd</B>

option,
or in the file
<B>$HOME/.xlockrc</B>,

with the first taking precedence.  In both cases an encrypted password
is expected (see <A HREF="http:/cgi-bin/man2html?man8/makekey.8">makekey</A>(8)).  If neither is given, then
<B>xlock</B>

will prompt for a password and will use that, also storing an
encrypted version of it in
<B>$HOME/.xlockrc</B>

for future use.
<P>
<A NAME="lbAK">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>BUGS</H2>

&quot;kill -KILL
<B>xlock</B>

&quot; causes the server that was locked to be unusable, since all hosts
(including localhost) were removed from the access control list
to lock out new X clients, and since
<B>xlock</B>

could not catch SIGKILL, it terminated before restoring the access
control list.  This will leave the X server in a state where
<I>&quot;you can no longer connect to that server,
and this operation cannot be reversed unless you reset the server.&quot;</I>
<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>-From the X11R4 Xlib Documentation, Chapter 7.<BR>
<BR>

NCD terminals do not allow xlock to remove all the hosts from the access
control list.  Therefore you will need to use the &quot;-remote&quot; and
&quot;-allowaccess&quot; switches.  If you happen to run without &quot;-allowaccess&quot; on an
NCD terminal,
<B>xlock</B>

will not work and you will need to reboot the terminal, or simply go into
the SETUP menus, under 'Network Parameters', and turn off TCP/IP access
control.
