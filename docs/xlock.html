<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
     <STRONG>xlock</STRONG> locks the X server till the user enters their password
     at  the  keyboard.   While  <STRONG>xlock</STRONG> is running, all new server
     connections are refused.  The screen saver is disabled.  The
     mouse  cursor  is  turned  off.  The screen is blanked and a
     changing pattern is put on the screen.  If a key or a  mouse
     button is pressed then the user is prompted for the password
     of the user who started <STRONG>xlock</STRONG>.

     If the  correct  password  is  typed,  then  the  screen  is
     unlocked  and  the  X  server  is restored.  When typing the
     password Control-U and Control-H  are  active  as  kill  and
     erase  respectively.   To return to the locked screen, click
     in the small icon version of the changing pattern.
     In  the  lower  part  of  the  password  screen  a  text  is
     displayed.  This message is taken from the first file of the
     following that exists:   $HOME/.xlocktext,  $HOME/.plan,  or
     $HOME/.signature.

     On systems which support new BSD style  authentication,  the
     password may be prefixed by an authentication style followed
     by a colon (i.e. "style:password").  See  the  login.conf(5)
     for more information on authentication styles.



</PRE>
<H2>NOTE ON ETIQUETTE</H2><PRE>
     <EM>Xlock</EM> should not be used on public terminals when there is a
     high demand for them.

     If you find a  public  terminal  that  has  been  locked  by
     another user and there are no other terminals available, and
     the terminal appears to have been  left  idle  for  a  while
     (normally  more than 15 minutes), it is fair to try to reset
     the session in some manner.

     -<STRONG>delay</STRONG> <EM>usecs</EM>
          The <EM>delay</EM> option sets the speed at which  a  mode  will
          operate.   It simply sets the number of microseconds to
          delay between batches of animations.  In blank mode, it
          is  important  to  set  this  to  some  small number of
          seconds,  because  the  keyboard  and  mouse  are  only
          checked  after  each delay, so you cannot set the delay
          too high, but a delay of zero would needlessly  consume
          cpu  checking  for  mouse and keyboard input in a tight
          loop, since blank mode has no work to do.

     -<STRONG>count</STRONG> <EM>num</EM>

          A negative <EM>count</EM> allows for randomness.  The range from
          the  minimum allowed nonnegative <EM>count</EM> for a particular
          mode to the ABS( <EM>count</EM> ) (or maximum  allowed  <EM>count</EM>  ,
          whichever is less).

     -<STRONG>batchcount</STRONG> <EM>num</EM>
          The <EM>batchcount</EM> option is deprecated  but  should  still
          work as <EM>count</EM>.

     -<STRONG>cycles</STRONG> <EM>num</EM>
          The <EM>cycles</EM> option sets the number of cycles until  time

          is  the  minimum  size of the squares, for kaleid it is
          the % of black, for qix it is the number of lines,  for
          spline  -erase it means the number of splines * 64 (for
          compatibility with +erase), for gears it is the  number
          of  degrees  to increment the spin of each gear by, for
          glplanet it is  the  number  of  hundredth  degrees  to

          the speed, for superquadrics it is the number of frames
          it  takes  to  morph  from  one  shape to another.  for
          text3d it is the number of times drawing a word  before
          the next one, For others it means nothing.

     -<STRONG>size</STRONG> <EM>num</EM>
          The <EM>size</EM> option sets the size maximum size of a star in
          bouboule,  pyro  and  star,  size  of  ball in ball and
          bounce, size of bat in bat, maximum size of  bubble  in

          voters,  wator,  and  wire.  In pipes it is the maximum
          length of a system.  In flow and swarm it is the length
          of  the  lines.   In  atlantis it is the shark size.  A
          negative  number  allows  for  randomness,  similar  to
          <EM>count</EM>.  In atunnels, fire, gears, sballs and sproingies
          it is the size of the screen  (default  400),  this  is
          because  on many slow systems it runs too slow when the
          picture covers the full screen.   Set  to  0  for  full
          screen on fast machines.

     -<STRONG>ncolors</STRONG> <EM>num</EM>
          The <EM>ncolors</EM> option sets the maximum number of colors to
          be used.

     -<STRONG>saturation</STRONG> <EM>value</EM>
          The <EM>saturation</EM> option sets saturation of the color ramp
          used  to  <EM>value</EM>  .  0  is  grayscale and 1 is very rich
          color.  0.4 is a nice pastel.

     -<STRONG>erasemode</STRONG> <EM>modename</EM>
          As of this writing there are over 12 erase  modes  sup-
          ported  (if  its  not  chosen its assumed random).  The
          erase modes are random_lines, random_squares, venetian,
          triple_wipe, quad_wipe, circle_wipe, three_circle_wipe,
          squaretate,  fizzle,   spiral,   slide_lines,   losira,
          no_fade.   <EM>modename</EM> is now similar to the option <STRONG>model-</STRONG>
          <STRONG>ist</STRONG> where you can it can be something like "all-losira"
          to  get  all erasemodes but losira.  Use a "+" or a ","
          to add modes like "spiral+venetian".

     -<STRONG>erasedelay</STRONG> <EM>usecs</EM>
          The <EM>erasedelay</EM> option sets the number  of  microseconds
          for  steps  of  the  <STRONG>erasemode</STRONG>  (a setting of 0 and the
          <STRONG>erasemode</STRONG> is bypassed).

     <STRONG>+/-nolock</STRONG>
          The <EM>nolock</EM> option causes <STRONG>xlock</STRONG> to only  draw  the  pat-
          terns and not lock the display.  A key press or a mouse
          click will terminate the screen saver.

     <STRONG>-/+inwindow</STRONG>
          Runs <STRONG>xlock</STRONG> in a window, so that you can iconify,  move,
          or resize it and still use your screen for other stuff.
          When running in a window, <STRONG>xlock</STRONG> no  longer  locks  your
          screen, it just looks good.

     <STRONG>-/+inroot</STRONG>
          Runs <STRONG>xlock</STRONG> in your  root  window.   Like  the  <EM>inwindow</EM>
          option  it  no  longer  locks the screen, it just looks
          good.

     <STRONG>-/+remote</STRONG>
          The <EM>remote</EM> option tells <STRONG>xlock</STRONG>  to  not  stop  you  from
          locking remote X11 servers.  This option should be used
          with care and is intended mainly to lock X11  terminals
          which  cannot  run  <STRONG>xlock</STRONG> locally.  If you lock someone
          else's workstation, they will have to know  <STRONG>your</STRONG>  pass-
          word   to  unlock  it.   Using  +<EM>remote</EM>  overrides  any
          resource derived values for <EM>remote</EM> and  prevents  <STRONG>xlock</STRONG>
          from  being  used  to lock other X11 servers.  (Use `+'
          instead of `-' to override resources for other  options
          that can take the `+' modifier similarly.)

     <STRONG>-/+mono</STRONG>
          The <EM>mono</EM> option causes  <STRONG>xlock</STRONG>  to  display  monochrome,
          (black  and  white)  pixels  rather  than  the  default
          colored ones on color displays.

     <STRONG>-/+allowaccess</STRONG>
          This option is required for servers which do not  allow
          clients  to modify the host access control list.  It is
          also useful if you need to run x clients  on  a  server
          which is locked for some reason...  When <EM>allowaccess</EM> is
          true, the X11 server is left open for clients to attach
          and  thus  lowers  the  inherent  security of this lock
          screen.  A side effect of using this option is that  if
          <STRONG>xlock</STRONG>  is  killed -KILL, the access control list is not
          lost.

     -<STRONG>vtlock</STRONG> <EM>modename</EM>
          This option is used on a XFree86 system  to  manage  VT
          switching in [off|noswitch|switch|restore] mode.

     <EM>off</EM>       means no VT switch locking.

     <EM>switch</EM>    means VT switch locking + switching  to  xlock  VT
               when activated.

     <EM>restore</EM>   means VT switch locking + switching  to  xlock  VT
               when  activated  +  switching  back to previous VT
               when desactivated.

     <EM>noswitch</EM>  means VT switch locking  only  when  xlock  VT  is
               active.

     <STRONG>-/+allowroot</STRONG>
          The <EM>allowroot</EM> option allows the root password to unlock
          the  server as well as the user who started <STRONG>xlock</STRONG>.  May
          not be able to turn this on and off depending  on  your
          system and how <STRONG>xlock</STRONG> was configured.

     <STRONG>-/+debug</STRONG>
          Allows <STRONG>xlock</STRONG> to be debugged by doing  all  but  locking
          the screen.

     <STRONG>-/+description</STRONG>
          The  <EM>description</EM>  option  causes  <STRONG>xlock</STRONG>  shows  a  mode
          description  above  password window.  The default is to
          show this description.

     <STRONG>-/+echokeys</STRONG>
          The <EM>echokeys</EM> option causes <STRONG>xlock</STRONG> to echo '?' characters
          (default)  for each key typed into the password prompt.
          Some consider this a security risk, so the  default  is
          to not echo anything.

     -<STRONG>echokey</STRONG> <EM>echokey</EM>
          The text character to use for echo key in <EM>echokeys</EM> .

     <STRONG>-/+enablesaver</STRONG>
          By default <STRONG>xlock</STRONG> will disable  the  normal  X  server's
          screen  saver  since  it is in effect a replacement for
          it.  Since it is possible to set delay parameters  long
          enough  to  cause  phosphor burn on some displays, this
          option will turn back on the default screen saver which
          is very careful to keep most of the screen black.

     <STRONG>-/+resetsaver</STRONG>
          By default <STRONG>xlock</STRONG> will call XResetScreenSaver.  This may
          be undesirable with DPMS monitors.

     <STRONG>-/+grabmouse</STRONG>
          The <EM>grabmouse</EM> option causes <STRONG>xlock</STRONG> to grab the mouse and
          keyboard,  this is the default.  <STRONG>xlock</STRONG> can not lock the
          screen without this.

     <STRONG>-/+grabserver</STRONG>
          The <EM>grabserver</EM> option causes <STRONG>xlock</STRONG> to grab the  server.
          This  is not usually needed but some unsecure X servers
          can be defeated without this.

     <STRONG>-/+install</STRONG>
          Allows <STRONG>xlock</STRONG> to install its own colormap if <STRONG>xlock</STRONG>  runs
          out  of  colors.   May  not  work  on  with some window
          managers (fvwm) and does  not  work  with  the  -inroot
          option.

     <STRONG>-/+mousemotion</STRONG>
          Allows you to turn on and off the  sensitivity  to  the
          mouse to bring up the password window.

     <STRONG>-/+sound</STRONG>
          Allows you to turn on and off sound if  installed  with
          the capability.

     <STRONG>-/+timeelapsed</STRONG>
          Allows you to find out how long a machine is locked  so
          you  can  complain  to an administrator that someone is
          hogging a machine.

     <STRONG>-/+usefirst</STRONG>
          The <EM>usefirst</EM> option causes <STRONG>xlock</STRONG> to use  the  keystroke
          which  got  you  to  the  password  screen as the first
          character in the password.  The default  is  to  ignore
          the first key pressed.

     <STRONG>-/+verbose</STRONG>
          Verbose mode, tells what options it is going to use.

     -<STRONG>nice</STRONG> <EM>nicelevel</EM>
          The <EM>nice</EM> option sets system nicelevel of the <STRONG>xlock</STRONG> pro-
          cess to <EM>nicelevel</EM> .

     -<STRONG>lockdelay</STRONG> <EM>seconds</EM>
          The <EM>lockdelay</EM> option sets the number of <EM>seconds</EM>  before
          the  screen  needs a password to be unlocked.  Good for
          use with an autolocking mechanism like xautolock(1).

     -<STRONG>timeout</STRONG> <EM>seconds</EM>
          The <EM>timeout</EM> option sets the number  of  <EM>seconds</EM>  before
          the password screen will time out.

     -<STRONG>font</STRONG> <EM>fontname</EM>
          The <EM>font</EM> option sets the font to be used on the  prompt
          screen.

     -<STRONG>planfont</STRONG> <EM>fontname</EM>
          option sets the font to be used for the  text  that  is
          displayed in the lower part of the password screen.

     -<STRONG>fg</STRONG> <EM>color</EM>
          The <EM>fg</EM> option sets the color of the text on  the  pass-
          word screen to <EM>color</EM> .

     -<STRONG>bg</STRONG> <EM>color</EM>
          The <EM>bg</EM> option sets the color of the background  on  the
          password screen to <EM>color</EM> .

     -<STRONG>foreground</STRONG> <EM>color</EM>
          The <EM>foreground</EM> option sets the color of the text on the
          password screen to <EM>color</EM> .

     -<STRONG>background</STRONG> <EM>color</EM>
          The <EM>background</EM> option sets the color of the  background
          on the password screen to <EM>color</EM> .

     -<STRONG>username</STRONG> <EM>string</EM>
          Text <EM>string</EM> is shown in front of user name, defaults to
          "Name: ".

     -<STRONG>password</STRONG> <EM>string</EM>
          Text <EM>string</EM> is the password prompt string, defaults  to
          "Password: ".

     -<STRONG>info</STRONG> <EM>string</EM>
          Text <EM>string</EM> is an informational  message  to  tell  the
          user what to do, defaults to "Enter password to unlock;
          select icon to lock.".

     -<STRONG>validate</STRONG> <EM>string</EM>
          Text <EM>string</EM> is a message  shown  while  validating  the
          password, defaults to "Validating login..."

     -<STRONG>invalid</STRONG> <EM>string</EM>
          Text  <EM>string</EM>  is  a  message  shown  when  password  is
          invalid, defaults to "Invalid login."

     -<STRONG>geometry</STRONG> <EM>geom</EM>
          The <EM>geometry</EM> option sets <EM>geom</EM> the size  and  offset  of
          the  lock  window  (normally  the  entire screen).  The
          entire screen format is still  used  for  entering  the
          password.  The purpose is to see the screen even though
          it is locked.  This should be used with  caution  since
          many of the modes will fail if the windows are far from
          square or are too small  (size  must  be  greater  than
          0x0).   This  should  also be used with -enablesaver to
          protect screen from phosphor burn.

     -<STRONG>icongeometry</STRONG> <EM>geom</EM>
          The <EM>icongeometry</EM> option  sets  <EM>geom</EM>  the  size  of  the
          iconic  screen  (normally 64x64) seen when entering the
          password.  This should be used with caution since  many
          of  the  modes  will  fail  if the windows are far from

<H2>**WARNING**</H2><PRE>
     <STRONG>xlock</STRONG> can appear to hang if it is  competing  with  a  high-
     priority  process  for  the  CPU.  For  example, if <STRONG>xlock</STRONG> is
     started after a process with  'nice  -20'  (high  priority),
     <STRONG>xlock</STRONG> will take  considerable amount of time to respond.



</PRE>
<H2>SHADOW PASSWORDS</H2><PRE>
     If the machine is using a shadow password system, then <STRONG>xlock</STRONG>
     may  not  be  set up to get the real password and so must be
     given one of its own. This can  be  either  on  the  command
     line,   via   the   <STRONG>-cpasswd</STRONG>   option,   or   in   the  file
     <STRONG>$HOME/.xlockrc</STRONG>, with the first taking precedence.   In  both
     cases  an  encrypted  password is expected (see makekey(8)).
     If neither is given, then <STRONG>xlock</STRONG> will prompt for  a  password
     and  will  use that, also storing an encrypted version of it
     in <STRONG>$HOME/.xlockrc</STRONG> for future use.



</PRE>
<H2>XLOCK AND SSH-AGENT</H2><PRE>
     If you use ssh-agent(1) to avoid entering a passphrase every
     time  you  use  one  of  your ssh(1) private keys, it's good
     security practice to have ssh-agent forget the  keys  before
     you  leave  your terminal unattended.  That way, an attacker
     who takes over your terminal  won't  be  able  to  use  your
     private  ssh  keys  to  log  in  to other systems.  Once you
     return to your terminal, you can enter  the  passphrase  and
     re-add the keys to ssh-agent.  There are a couple of ways in
     which <STRONG>xlock</STRONG> can help to automate this process.  Firstly, the
     <EM>startCmd</EM>  option  allows <STRONG>xlock</STRONG> to be configured to run 'ssh-
     add -D' every time you lock the screen, so  that  your  keys
     are automatically deleted from ssh-agent.  If the passphrase
     on your ssh keys is the same as your  password,  then  <STRONG>xlock</STRONG>
     can  also  be  made to re-add the keys to ssh-agent when you
     unlock  the  screen,  via  the  <EM>pipepassCmd</EM>  option.    This
     requires  a  bit of scripting, as the command must read your
     password from standard input and then automate the  interac-
     tion  with  ssh-add to re-add the keys.  There is an example
     of  such  a  script  in  the  <STRONG>xlock</STRONG>   distribution   -   see
     <EM>etc</EM>/<EM>xlockssh</EM>*



</PRE>
<H2>BUGS</H2><PRE>
     "kill -KILL <STRONG>xlock</STRONG> " causes the server that was locked to  be
     unusable, since all hosts (including localhost) were removed
     from the access control list to lock out new X clients,  and
     since  <STRONG>xlock</STRONG>  could  not catch SIGKILL, it terminated before
     restoring the access control list.  This will  leave  the  X
     server  in  a state where "<EM>you</EM> <EM>can</EM> <EM>no</EM> <EM>longer</EM> <EM>connect</EM> <EM>to</EM> <EM>that</EM>
     <EM>server</EM>, <EM>and</EM> <EM>this</EM> <EM>operation</EM> <EM>cannot</EM>  <EM>be</EM>  <EM>reversed</EM>  <EM>unless</EM>  <EM>you</EM>
     <EM>reset</EM>  <EM>the</EM> <EM>server</EM>."            -From the X11R4 Xlib Documen-
     tation, Chapter 7.
     NCD terminals do not allow xlock to  remove  all  the  hosts
     from  the  access  control list.  Therefore you will need to
     use the "-remote" and "-allowaccess" switches.  If you  hap-
     pen  to run without "-allowaccess" on an NCD terminal, <STRONG>xlock</STRONG>
     will not work and you will need to reboot the  terminal,  or
     simply  go into the SETUP menus, under 'Network Parameters',
     and turn off TCP/IP access control.
