.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fIifs\fP program draws spinning, colliding iterated-function-system images.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 8
.B \-visual \fIvisual\fP
Specify which visual to use.  Legal values are the name of a visual class,
or the id number (decimal or hex) of a specific visual.
.TP 8
.B \-window
Draw on a newly-created window.  This is the default.
.TP 8
.B \-root
Draw on the root window.
.TP 8
.B \-no\-db
Disable double-buffering.
.TP 8
.B \-delay \fInumber\fP
Per-frame delay, in microseconds.  Default: 20000
.TP 8
.B \-colors \fInumber\fP
Number of colours to use. Default: 200
.TP 8
.B \-detail \fInumber\fP
In \fI\-iterate\fP mode, number of times to randomly iterate the
functions, in thousands.  In \fI\-recurse\fP mode, number of times
to apply functions (recursion depth) before drawing each point.
Default: 9
.TP 8
.B \-functions \fInumber\fP
Number of functions to be iterated. Default: 3
.TP 8
.B \-iterate
Calculate by iteratively applying the functions in a random order,
usually faster than \fI\-recurse\fP.  This is the default.
.TP 8
.B \-recurse
Calculate by recursively applying all combinations of the functions.
This is the historical behavior and may produce neater output than
\fI\-iterate\fP.
.TP 8
.B \-no-rotate
Disable the rotation component of the functions.
.TP 8
.B \-no-scale
Disable the scaling component of the functions.
.TP 8
.B \-no-translate
Disable the varying translation component of the functions.
.TP 8
.B \-no-multi
Turn off multi-coloured mode, only one colour is used to colour the whole set.
.TP 8
.B \-fps
Display the current frame rate and CPU load.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.PP
.TP 8
.B DISPLAY
to get the default host and display number.
.TP 8
.B XENVIRONMENT
to get the name of a resource file that overrides the global resources
stored in the RESOURCE_MANAGER property.
