.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fIslidescreen\fP program takes an image, divides it into
a grid, deletes a random square of that grid, and then randomly slides 
one of the neighbors of this "hole" into the hole (and repeat.)

The image that it manipulates will be grabbed from the portion of
the screen underlying the window, or from the system's video input,
or from a random file on disk, as indicated by
the \fIgrabDesktopImages\fP, \fIgrabVideoFrames\fP,
and \fIchooseRandomImages\fP options in the \fI~/.xscreensaver\fP
file; see
.BR xscreensaver\-settings (1)
for more details.

.B \-delay \fImicroseconds\fP
How much of a delay should be introduced between steps of the animation of
