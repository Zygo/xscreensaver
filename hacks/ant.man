.SH DESCRIPTION
A cellular automaton that is really a two-dimensional Turing machine: as
the heads ("ants") walk along the screen, they change pixel values in
their path. Then, as they pass over changed pixels, their behavior is
influenced.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 8
.B \-visual \fIvisual\fP
Specify which visual to use.  Legal values are the name of a visual class,
or the id number (decimal or hex) of a specific visual.
.TP 8
.B \-window
Draw on a newly-created window.  This is the default.
.TP 8
.B \-root
Draw on the root window.
.TP 8
.B \-sharpturns | \-no-sharpturns
Whether to do sharp turns.
.TP 8
.B \-truchet | \-no-truchet
Whether to use truchet lines.
.TP 8
.B \-eyes | \-no-eyes
Whether to draw eyes on the ants.
.TP 8
.B \-delay \fInumber\fP
Per-frame delay, in microseconds.  Default: 1000 (0.0001 seconds.).
.TP 8
.B \-cycles \fInumber\fP
How long to wait until resetting.  0 - 800000.  Default: 40000.
.TP 8
.B \-count \fInumber\fP
Ants Count.  -20 - 20.	Default: -3.
.TP 8
.B \-size \fInumber\fP
Ant Size.  -18 - 18.  Default: -12.
.TP 8
.B \-neighbors \fIN\fP
How many neighbors each cell has.  Legal values are 3, 4, 6, 9, and 12.
.TP 8
.B \-ncolors \fInumber\fP
Number of colors.  Default: 64.
.TP 8
.B \-fps
Display the current frame rate and CPU load.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.PP
.TP 8
.B DISPLAY
to get the default host and display number.
.TP 8
.B XENVIRONMENT
to get the name of a resource file that overrides the global resources
stored in the RESOURCE_MANAGER property.
