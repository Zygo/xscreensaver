.SH DESCRIPTION

The \fIrd-bomb\fP program draws reaction/diffusion textures.  The code
is derived from the 'd' mode of the "bomb" visual musical instrument
(see http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~spot/bomb.html).  I got the equations from
xmorphia (http://www.ccsf.caltech.edu/ismap/image.html), which is
based on a version of the Gray-Scott model taken from:
    John E. Pearson "Complex Patterns in a Simple System"
    Science, 261,189, 9 July 1993.

If the frame-rate is too low, consider decreasing the width and height
of the tile, or decreasing the size of the active part of the screen.

.SH OPTIONS

If one of the reaction, diffusion, radius, and palette options is set
to a negative value, then that option will be set to a random
appropriate value.

Be sure to try "-speed 1 -size 0.1 -epoch 3000".

.I rd-bomb
accepts the following options:
.TP 8
.B \-window
Draw on a newly-created window.  This is the default.
.TP 8
.B \-root
Draw on the root window.
.TP 8
.B \-install
Install a private colormap for the window.
.TP 8
.B \-visual \fIvisual\fP
Specify which visual to use.  Legal values are the name of a visual class,
or the id number (decimal or hex) of a specific visual.
.TP 8
.B \-width \fIn\fP
.TP 8
.B \-height \fIn\fP
Specify the size of the tile, in pixels.
.TP 8
.B \-reaction \fIn\fP
.TP 8
.B \-diffusion \fIn\fP
These are constants in the equations that effect its visual nature.
Each may be one of 0, 1, or 2. Default is -1: these constants are
chosen randomly.
.TP 8
.B \-radius \fIn\fP
Size of the seed.
.TP 8
.B \-size \fIf\fP
What fraction of the window is actively drawn, a floating point number
between 0 (exclusive) and 1 (inclusive).  Default is 1.0.
.TP 8
.B \-speed \fIf\fP
When a fraction of the screen is active, the active area moves at this
rate (a floating point number).  Default is zero.  Suggested value: 1.0.
.TP 8
.B \-delay \fImillisecs\fP
How many milliseconds to delay between frames; default 1, or 
about 1/1000th of a second.
.TP 8
.B \-fps
Display the current frame rate and CPU load.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.PP
.TP 8
.B DISPLAY
to get the default host and display number.
.TP 8
.B XENVIRONMENT
to get the name of a resource file that overrides the global resources
stored in the RESOURCE_MANAGER property.
