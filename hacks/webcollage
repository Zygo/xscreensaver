  #
  # I do not want webcollage to filter on content: I want it to select
  # randomly from the set of images on the web.  All the logic here for
  # rejecting some images is really a set of heuristics for rejecting
  # images that are not really images: for rejecting *text* that is in
  # GIF/JPEG/PNG form.  I don't want text, I want pictures, and I want
  # the content of the pictures to be randomly selected from among all
  # the available content.
  #
  # So, filtering out "dirty" pictures by looking for "dirty" keywords
  # would be wrong: dirty pictures exist, like it or not, so webcollage
  # should be able to select them.
  #
  # However, picking a random URL is a hard thing to do.  The mechanism I'm
  # using is to search for a selection of random words.  This is not
  # perfect, but works ok most of the time.  The way it breaks down is when
  # some URLs get precedence because their pages list *every word* as
  # related -- those URLs come up more often than others.
  #
  # So, after we've retrieved a URL, if it has too many keywords, reject
  # it.  We reject it not on the basis of what those keywords are, but on
  # the basis that by having so many, the page has gotten an unfair
  # advantage against our randomizer.
