.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fIglmatrix\fP program draws the 3D "digital rain" effect, as seen
in the title sequence of the Wachowski brothers' film, "The Matrix".

Also see
.BR xmatrix (MANSUFFIX)
for a 2D rendering of the similar effect that appeared on the
computer monitors actually \fIin\fP the movie.
.SH OPTIONS
.I glmatrix
accepts the following options:
.TP 8
.B \-window
Draw on a newly-created window.  This is the default.
.TP 8
.B \-root
Draw on the root window.
.TP 8
.B \-install
Install a private colormap for the window.
.TP 8
.B \-visual \fIvisual\fP\fP
Specify which visual to use.  Legal values are the name of a visual class,
or the id number (decimal or hex) of a specific visual.
.TP 8
.B \-delay \fIusecs\fP
The delay between frames of the animation, in microseconds: default 30000.
.TP 8
.B \-speed \fIratio\fP
How fast the glyphs should move; default 1.0.  2.0 means twice as fast,
0.5 means half as fast.
.TP 8
.B \-density \fIpercentage\fP
The approximate percentage of the screen that should be filled with 
characters at any given time.  Default 20%.
.TP 8
.B \-no\-fog
By default, glyphs are dimmer the farther away they are.  This 
argument disables that.
.TP 8
.B \-no\-waves
By default, waves of color roll down the columns of glyphs.  This
argument disables that.
.TP 8
.B \-no-rotate\fP
By default, the scene slowly tilts and rotates.  This
argument disables that.
.TP 8
.B \-binary\fP
Instead of displaying Matrix glyphs, only display ones and zeros.
.TP 8
.B \-hexadecimal\fP
Instead of displaying Matrix glyphs, display hexadecimal digits.
.TP 8
.B \-dna\fP
Instead of displaying Matrix glyphs, display genetic code
(guanine, adenine, thymine, and cytosine.)
.TP 8
.B \-clock\fP
Hide a clock displaying the current time somewhere in the glyphs.
.TP 8
.B \-timefmt\fP \fIstrftime-string\fP
How to format the clock when \fI\-clock\fP is specified.
Default "\ %l%M%p\ ".
.TP 8
.B \-speed \fIratio\fP
Less than 1 for slower, greater than 1 for faster.  Default 1.
.TP 8
.B \-wireframe
Just draw boxes instead of textured characters.
.TP 8
.B \-fps
Display the current frame rate, CPU load, and polygon count.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.PP
.TP 8
.B DISPLAY
to get the default host and display number.
.TP 8
.B XENVIRONMENT
to get the name of a resource file that overrides the global resources
stored in the RESOURCE_MANAGER property.
