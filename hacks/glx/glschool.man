.SH DESCRIPTION
Uses Craig Reynolds Boids algorithm to simulate a 3d school of
fish.  See <http://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids> for a description
of the algorithm and the original paper.  This is a lightly modified
version of the algorithm that supports goal attraction.

Many different behaviors are possible by tweaking the parameters.  No sanity checking is performed
on the command line params, so if you want to use negative accelerations or minimum velocity that is
larger than maximum velocity or that sort of thing, the simulation will try to digest it.

It looks best with the highest number of fish that will give you an FPS of > 25 or so.
