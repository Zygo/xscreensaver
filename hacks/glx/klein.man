.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fIklein\fP program shows three different Klein bottles in 4d: the
figure-8 Klein bottle, the pinched torus Klein bottle, or the Lawson
Klein bottle.  You can walk on the Klein bottle, see it turn in 4d, or
walk on it while it turns in 4d.  The figure-8 Klein bottle is well
known in its 3d form.  The 4d form used in this program is an
extension of the 3d form to 4d that does not intersect itself in 4d
(which can be seen in the depth colors mode when using static colors).
The pinched torus Klein bottle also does not intersect itself in 4d
(which can be seen in the depth colors mode when using static colors).
The Lawson Klein bottle, on the other hand, does intersect itself in
4d.  Its primary use is that it has a nice appearance for walking and
for turning in 3d.
.PP
The Klein bottle is a non-orientable surface.  To make this apparent,
the two-sided color mode can be used.  Alternatively, orientation
markers (curling arrows) can be drawn as a texture map on the surface
of the Klein bottle.  While walking on the Klein bottle, you will
notice that the orientation of the curling arrows changes (which it
must because the Klein bottle is non-orientable).
.PP
The program projects the 4d Klein bottle to 3d using either a
perspective or an orthographic projection.  Which of the two
alternatives looks more appealing depends on the viewing mode and the
Klein bottle.  For example, the Lawson Klein bottle looks nicest when
projected perspectively.  The figure-8 Klein bottle, on the other
hand, looks nicer while walking when projected orthographically from
4d.  For the pinched torus Klein bottle, both projection modes give
equally acceptable projections.
.PP
The projected Klein bottle can then be projected to the screen either
perspectively or orthographically.  When using the walking modes,
perspective projection to the screen should be used.
.PP
There are three display modes for the Klein bottle: mesh (wireframe),
solid, or transparent.  Furthermore, the appearance of the Klein
bottle can be as a solid object or as a set of see-through bands.
Finally, the colors with with the Klein bottle is drawn can be set to
one-sided, two-sided, rainbow, or depth.  In one-sided mode, the Klein
bottle is drawn with the same color on both "sides."  In two-sided
mode (using static colors), the Klein bottle is drawn with red on one
"side" and green on the "other side."  Of course, the Klein bottle
only has one side, so the color jumps from red to green along a curve
on the surface of the Klein bottle.  This mode enables you to see that
the Klein bottle is non-orientable.  If changing colors are used in
two-sided mode, changing complementary colors are used on the
respective "sides."  The rainbow color mode (using static colors)
draws the Klein bottle with a color wheel of fully saturated rainbow
colors.  If changing colors are used, the color wheel's colors change
dynamically.  The rainbow color mode gives a very nice effect when
combined with the see-through bands mode or with the orientation
markers drawn.  The depth color mode draws the Klein bottle with
colors that are chosen according to the 4d "depth" of the points.  If
static colors are used, this mode enables you to see that the figure-8
and pinched torus Klein bottles do not intersect themselves in 4d,
while the Lawson Klein bottle does intersect itself.
.PP
The rotation speed for each of the six planes around which the Klein
bottle rotates can be chosen.  For the walk-and-turn mode, only the
rotation speeds around the true 4d planes are used (the xy, xz, and yz
planes).
.PP
Furthermore, in the walking modes the walking direction in the 2d base
square of the Klein bottle and the walking speed can be chosen.
.PP
This program is somewhat inspired by Thomas Banchoff's book "Beyond
the Third Dimension: Geometry, Computer Graphics, and Higher
Dimensions", Scientific American Library, 1990.

.PP
The following six options determine the rotation speed of the Klein
bottle around the six possible hyperplanes.  The rotation speed is
measured in degrees per frame.  The speeds should be set to relatively
small values, e.g., less than 4 in magnitude.  In walk mode, all
speeds are ignored.  In walk-and-turn mode, the 3d rotation speeds are
ignored (i.e., the wx, wy, and wz speeds).  In walk-and-turn mode,
smaller speeds must be used than in the turn mode to achieve a nice
visualization.  Therefore, in walk-and-turn mode the speeds you have
selected are divided by 5 internally.
.TP 8

Rotation speed around the wx plane (default: 1.1).
.TP 8

.TP 8
.B \-speed-yz \fIfloat\fP
Rotation speed around the yz plane (default: 2.1).
.PP
The following two options determine the walking speed and direction.
.TP 8
.B \-walk-direction \fIfloat\fP
The walking direction is measured as an angle in degrees in the 2d
square that forms the coordinate system of the surface of the Klein
bottle (default: 7.0).
.TP 8
.B \-walk-speed \fIfloat\fP
The walking speed is measured in percent of some sensible maximum
speed (default: 20.0).
.SH INTERACTION
If you run this program in standalone mode in its turn mode, you can
rotate the Klein bottle by dragging the mouse while pressing the left
mouse button.  This rotates the Klein bottle in 3D, i.e., around the
wx, wy, and wz planes.  If you press the shift key while dragging the
mouse with the left button pressed the Klein bottle is rotated in 4D,
i.e., around the xy, xz, and yz planes.  To examine the Klein bottle
at your leisure, it is best to set all speeds to 0.  Otherwise, the
Klein bottle will rotate while the left mouse button is not pressed.
This kind of interaction is not available in the two walk modes.
