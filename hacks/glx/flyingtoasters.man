The original After Dark flying toasters, with the fluffy white wings,
were a trademark of Berkeley Systems.  Berkeley Systems ceased to exist
some time in 1998, having been gobbled up by Sierra Online, who were
subsequently gobbled up by Flipside and/or Vivendi (it's hard to tell
exactly what happened when.)

I doubt anyone even cares any more, but if they do, hopefully this
homage, with the space-age 3D jet-plane toasters, will be considered
different enough that whoever still owns the trademark to the
fluffy-winged 2D bitmapped toasters won't get all huffy at us.
