.SH DESCRIPTION
Draws a wobbling blob, making use of alpha blending, fog,
textures, and lighting, plus a ``frames per second'' meter so that you can
tell how fast your graphics card is... Requires OpenGL.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 8
.B \-visual \fIvisual\fP
Specify which visual to use.  Legal values are the name of a visual class,
or the id number (decimal or hex) of a specific visual.
.TP 8
.B \-window
Draw on a newly-created window.  This is the default.
.TP 8
.B \-root
Draw on the root window.
.B \-wire
Render in wireframe instead of solid.
.TP 8
.B \-delay \fInumber\fP
Per-frame delay, in microseconds.  Default: 10000 (0.01 seconds.).
.TP 8
.B \-fog | \-no-fog
Whether to enable fog.
.TP 8
.B \-walls | \-no-walls
Add walls for blob to hit.
.TP 8
.B \-colour | \-no-colour
Draw coloured blob.  If also textured, the texture will have color mixed in.
.TP 8
.B \-texture | \-no-texture
Whether to wrap a texture image on the blob.
.TP 8
.B \-offset_texture | \-no-offset_texture
Whether to ofset the texture calculations to only use a region of the image
 under the blob.  This works well with a semi-transparent blob.
.TP 8
.B \-blend | \-no-blend
Whether to draw a transparent blob. (see also offset_texture above)
.TP 8
.B \-antialias | \-no-antialias
Whether to antialias lines.
.TP 8
.B \-resolution \fInumber\fP
Resolution of the tessellation used to calculate and draw the blob.  Larger
 numbers give a smoother blob but increase calculation times exponentially.
.TP 8
.B \-bumps \fInumber\fP
Number of bumps used to distort the blob.
.TP 8
.B \-hold-time \fInumber\fP
Time until loading a new image.
.TP 8
.B \-fade-time \fInumber\fP
Time taken to transition between images.
.TP 8
.B \-zoom \fInumber\fP
Size multiplier for blob.
.TP 8
.B \-fps
Display the current frame rate, CPU load, and polygon count.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.PP
.TP 8
.B DISPLAY
to get the default host and display number.
.TP 8
.B XENVIRONMENT
to get the name of a resource file that overrides the global resources
stored in the RESOURCE_MANAGER property.
