.SH DESCRIPTION
Generates an infinitely-scrolling sequence of dazzle camouflage patterns.
Dazzle Ships were military vessels during World War I and early in World
War II that were painted not to conceal but to confuse: with these Cubist
overlapping stripes, it was very hard to estimate their size, range and
heading. This was a big deal before the invention of Radar.
