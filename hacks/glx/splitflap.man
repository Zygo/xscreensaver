Draw on a newly-created window.  This is the default.
.TP 8
.B \-root
Draw on the root window.
.TP 8
.B \-delay \fInumber\fP
Per-frame delay, in microseconds.  Default: 20000 (0.02 seconds).
.TP 8
.B \-speed \fInumber\fP
Animation speed.  2.0 means twice as fast, 0.5 means half as fast.
.TP 8
.B \-width \fInumber\fP
Columns of the display.  Default: 22.
.TP 8
.B \-height \fInumber\fP
Rows of the display. Default: 8.
.TP 8
.B \-mode clock12
Display a 12-hour clock.
.TP 8
.B \-mode clock24
Display a 24-hour clock.
.TP 8
.B \-front | \-no-front
When spinning, never spin all the way around or upside down:
always face mostly forward so that the text is easily readable.
This is the default.
.TP 8
.B \-no\-front
Allow spins to go all the way around or upside down.
.TP 8
.B \-wander | \-no-wander
Whether the object should wander around the screen.
.TP 8
.B \-spin
Which axes around which the text should spin.  The default is "XYZ",
meaning rotate it freely in space.  "\fB\-spin Z\fP" would rotate the
text in the plane of the screen while not rotating it into or out
of the screen; etc.
.TP 8
.B \-wireframe | \-no-wireframe
Render in wireframe instead of solid.
.TP 8
.B \-fps | \-no-fps
Whether to show a frames-per-second display at the bottom of the screen.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.PP
.TP 8
.B DISPLAY
to get the default host and display number.
.TP 8
.B XENVIRONMENT
