.SH DESCRIPTION
Flipflop draws a grid of 3D colored tiles that change positions with 
each other.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 8
.B \-visual \fIvisual\fP
Specify which visual to use.  Legal values are the name of a visual class,
or the id number (decimal or hex) of a specific visual.
.TP 8
.B \-window
Draw on a newly-created window.  This is the default.
.TP 8
.B \-root
Draw on the root window.
.TP 8
.B \-count \fInumber\fP
Number of tiles on the board. A value of "0" means "default". The
default number of tiles depends on the size of the board and the mode:
95% of total tiles for "tiles" mode and 80% of total sticks for
"sticks" mode (e.g. 76 tiles or 64 sticks for a 9x9 board). 
.TP 8
.B \-free \fInumber\fP
Number of tiles missing from the board. See -count. 
.TP 8
.B \-size \fInumber\fP
Number of tiles on each side of the board. Takes precedence over
-size-x and -size-y. Default: 9.
.TP 8
.B \-size-x \fInumber\fP
Width (in tiles) of the board. Default: 9.
.TP 8
.B \-size-y \fInumber\fP
Length (in tiles) of the board. Default: 9.
.TP 8
.B \-spin \fInumber\fP
Angular velocity for the rotation of the board. 
.TP 8
.B \-mode sticks 
Draw hopping sticks instead of flipping tiles. 
.TP 8
.B \-mode tiles 
Draw flipping tiles. This is the default. 
.TP 8
.B \-delay \fInumber\fP
Per-frame delay, in microseconds.  Default: 20000 (0.02 seconds.).
.TP 8
.B \-fps | \-no\-fps
Display the current frame rate, CPU load, and polygon count.
.TP 8
.B \-wireframe
Only draw outlines.
.TP 8
.B \-texture | \-no\-texture
Whether to texture the tiles with a screen grab or an image.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.PP
.TP 8
.B DISPLAY
to get the default host and display number.
.TP 8
.B XENVIRONMENT
to get the name of a resource file that overrides the global resources
stored in the RESOURCE_MANAGER property.
