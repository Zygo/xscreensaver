.SH DESCRIPTION
Loads several random images, and displays them flying in a circular
formation.  The circle changes speed and direction randomly, tilts on
its axis, and the images move in and out.

This program requires a good video card capable of supporting large
textures.

To specify the directory that images are loaded from, run
.BR xscreensaver\-settings (1)
and click on the "Advanced" tab.
