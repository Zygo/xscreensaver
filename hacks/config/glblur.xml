  <_description>
This draws a box and a few line segments, and generates a
radial blur outward from it.  This creates flowing field effects.

This is done by rendering the scene into a small texture, then
repeatedly rendering increasingly-enlarged and increasingly-transparent
versions of that texture onto the frame buffer.  As such, it's quite
GPU-intensive: if you don't have a very good graphics card, it
will hurt your machine bad.
