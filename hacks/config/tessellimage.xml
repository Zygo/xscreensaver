Converts an image to triangles using Delaunay tessellation, and
animates the result at various depths.

More triangles are allocated to visually complex parts of the image.
This is accomplished by first computing the first derivative of the
image: the distance between each pixel and its neighbors (which is
essentially edge detection or embossing).  Then the Delaunay control
points are chosen by selecting those pixels whose distance value is
above a certain threshold: those are the pixels that have the largest
change in color/brightness.
