The symptoms most commonly produced by Enrichment Center testing are
superstition, perceiving inanimate objects as alive, and hallucinations.
The Enrichment Center reminds you that the weighted companion cube will
never threaten to stab you and, in fact, cannot speak.  In the event that
the Weighted Companion Cube does speak, the Enrichment Center urges you to
disregard its advice.
