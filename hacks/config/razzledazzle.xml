Generates an infinitely-scrolling sequence of dazzle camouflage patterns.

Dazzle Ships, in addition to being the best album by Orchestral
Manoeuvres in the Dark, were military vessels during World War I and
early in World War II that were painted not to conceal but to confuse:
with these Cubist overlapping stripes, it was very hard to estimate
their size, range and heading.  This was a big deal before the
invention of Radar.
