This screen saver was removed from the XScreenSaver distribution as of
version 4.22.

A cellular automaton that is really a two-dimensional Turing machine:
as the heads ("ants") walk along the screen, they change pixel
values in their path.  Then, as they pass over changed pixels, their
behavior is influenced.
