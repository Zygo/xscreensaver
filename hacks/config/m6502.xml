  <_description> 
The m6502 screensaver emulates a 6502 microprocessor.  The family
of 6502 chips were used throughout the 70's and 80's in machines
such as the Atari 2600, Commodore PET, VIC20 and C64, Apple ][,
and the NES. Some example programs are included, and it can also
read in an assembly file as input.
