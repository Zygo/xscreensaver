This is what the Internet looks like.

This creates collages out of random images from the World Wide Web.
It finds the images by feeding random words into various search
engines, and pulling images (or sections of images) out of the pages
returned.

WARNING: THE INTERNET SOMETIMES CONTAINS PORNOGRAPHY.

The Internet being what it is, absolutely anything might show up in the
collage including -- quite possibly -- pornography, or even nudity.
Please act accordingly.
