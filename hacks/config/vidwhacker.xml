Displays a distorted frame of video from the system's camera.

This is a shell script that grabs a frame of video from the system's
video input, and then uses some PBM filters (chosen at random) to
manipulate and recombine the video frame in various ways (edge
detection, subtracting the image from a rotated version of itself,
etc.)  Then it displays that image for a few seconds, and does it
again.  This works really well if you just feed broadcast television
into it.

Written by Jamie Zawinski; 1998.
