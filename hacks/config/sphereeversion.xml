SphereEversion draws an animation of a sphere being turned inside out.
A sphere can be turned inside out, without any tears, sharp creases or
discontinuities, if the surface of the sphere is allowed to intersect
itself.  This program animates what is known as the Thurston Eversion.
Written by Nathaniel Thurston and Michael McGuffin.  This program is
not included with the XScreenSaver package, but if you don't have it
already, you can find it at
