A Voronoi tessellation.  Periodically zooms in and adds new points.
The existing points also wander around.

There are a set of control points on the plane, each at the center of
a colored cell.  Every pixel within that cell is closer to that cell's
control point than to any other control point.  That is what
determines the cell's shapes.
