Hyperball is to hypercube as dodecahedron is to cube: this displays
a 2D projection of the sequence of 3D objects which are the projections
of the 4D analog to the dodecahedron.  Technically, it is a "120 cell 
polytope."  Written by Joe Keane.

See also the "polytopes" hack for a more general version of this
using OpenGL.
