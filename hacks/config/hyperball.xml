This screen saver was removed from the XScreenSaver distribution as of
version 5.10.  It has been replaced by the more general "Polytopes"
screen saver, which can display this object as well as others.  The
Polytopes "120-cell" object corresponds to this one.

Hyperball is to hypercube as dodecahedron is to cube: this displays
a 2D projection of the sequence of 3D objects which are the projections
of the 4D analog to the dodecahedron.  Technically, it is a "120 cell
polytope".
