This screen saver was removed from the XScreenSaver distribution as of
version 5.10.  It has been replaced by the more general "Polytopes"
screen saver, which can display this object as well as others.

This displays 2D projections of the sequence of 3D objects which are
the projections of the 4D analog to the cube: as a square is composed
of four lines, each touching two others; and a cube is composed of
six squares, each touching four others; a hypercube is composed of
eight cubes, each touching six others.  To make it easier to
visualize the rotation, it uses a different color for the edges of
each face.  Don't think about it too long, or your brain will melt.
