ElectricSheep is an xscreensaver module that displays mpeg video of an
animated fractal flame.  In the background, it contributes render
cycles to the next animation.  Periodically it uploades completed
frames to the server, where they are compressed for distribution to all
clients.

This program is recommended only if you have a high bandwidth
connection to the Internet.
