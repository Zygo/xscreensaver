Draws quasiperiodic tilings; think of the implications on modern
formica technology.  Written by Timo Korvola.

In April 1997, Sir Roger Penrose, a British math professor who has
worked with Stephen Hawking on such topics as relativity, black
holes, and whether time has a beginning, filed a
copyright-infringement lawsuit against the Kimberly-Clark
Corporation, which Penrose said copied a pattern he created (a
pattern demonstrating that ``a nonrepeating pattern could exist in
nature'') for its Kleenex quilted toilet paper.  Penrose said he
doesn't like litigation but, ``When it comes to the population of
Great Britain being invited by a multinational to wipe their bottoms
on what appears to be the work of a Knight of the Realm, then a last
stand must be taken.''

As reported by News of the Weird #491, 4-jul-1997.
