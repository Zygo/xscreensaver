Hacking the Gibson, as per the 1995 classic film, HACKERS.

Cereal Killer: "Oh yeah, you want a seriously righteous hack, you score
one of those Gibsons, man.  You know, supercomputers they use to like,
do physics, and look for oil and stuff?"

Phantom Phreak: "Ain't no way, man, security's too tight. The big iron?"

Zero Cool: "Maybe. But, if I were gonna hack some heavy metal, I'd, uh,
work my way back through some low security, and try the back door."

Cereal Killer: "Yeah but oh man, wouldn't you just love to get one of
those Gibsons, baby? Ooooh!"

Phantom Phreak: "Yo, who ate all of my fries?"
