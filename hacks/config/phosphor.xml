  <_description>
Draws a simulation of an old terminal, with large pixels and
long-sustain phosphor.

On MacOS and Linux, this program is also a fully-functional VT100
emulator!  Run it as an application instead of as a screen saver and
you can use it as a terminal.

Written by Jamie Zawinski; 1999.
