This draws set of animating, transparent, amoeba-like blobs.  The
blobs change shape as they wander around the screen, and they are
translucent, so you can see the lower blobs through the higher ones,
and when one passes over another, their colors merge.  Written by
Jamie Zawinski.  I got the idea for this from a cool mouse pad I
have, which achieves the same kind of effect in real life by having
several layers plastic with colored oil between them.  Written by
Jamie Zawinski.
