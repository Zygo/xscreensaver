The Esper Machine was a voice-controlled forensic device used by LAPD
in 2019, as documented in the 1982 film, Blade Runner.  It was capable
of enhancing photographs to an extreme degree, including reconstructing
different viewpoints within the space from the reflections on various
objects in the photograph.
