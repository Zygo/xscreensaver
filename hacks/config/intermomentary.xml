Blinking dots interact with each other circularly.

A surface is filled with a hundred medium to small sized circles.
Each circle has a different size and direction, but moves at the same
slow rate.  Displays the instantaneous intersections of the circles as
well as the aggregate intersections of the circles.

The circles begin with a radius of 1 pixel and slowly increase to some
arbitrary size.  Circles are drawn with small moving points along the
perimeter. The intersections are rendered as glowing orbs.  Glowing
orbs are rendered only when a perimeter point moves past the
intersection point.
