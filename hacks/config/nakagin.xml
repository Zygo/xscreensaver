The Nakagin Capsule Tower was demolished in 2022, but this version will
continue to grow forever.

Constructed in 1972, the building was composed of small prefabricated rooms
attached to the two central towers.  The capsules were intended to be mass
produced and replaceable.  Utilities and fittings were installed before the
capsules were shipped to the site.
