This one draws cool circular interference patterns.  Most of the
circles you see aren't explicitly rendered, but show up as a result
of interactions between the other pixels that were drawn.  Written by
Jamie Zawinski, inspired by Java code by Michael Bayne.  As he
pointed out, the beauty of this one is that the heart of the display
algorithm can be expressed with just a pair of loops and a handful of
arithmetic, giving it a high ``display hack metric''.
