.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fIstarfish\fP program draws radially symmetric objects, which expand,
contract, rotate, and turn inside out.  It uses these shapes to lay down a
field of smooth colors, and then rotates the colormap.
.SH OPTIONS
.I starfish
accepts the following options:
.TP 8
.B \-window
Draw on a newly-created window.  This is the default.
.TP 8
.B \-root
Draw on the root window.
.TP 8
.B \-mono 
If on a color display, pretend we're on a monochrome display.
.TP 8
.B \-install
Install a private colormap for the window.
.TP 8
.B \-visual \fIvisual\fP
Specify which visual to use.  Legal values are the name of a visual class,
or the id number (decimal or hex) of a specific visual.
.TP 8
.B \-delay \fImicroseconds\fP
How much of a delay should be introduced between steps of the animation.
Default 10000, or about 1/100th second.
.TP 8
.B \-thickness \fIpixels\fP
How wide each color band should be.  Default 0, meaning random (the chosen
value will be between 0 and 15.)
.TP 8
.B \-rotation \fIdegrees\fP
How quickly the objects should rotate at each step.  Default 0, meaning 
random (the chosen value will be between 0 and 12 degrees.)
.TP 8
.B \-colors \fIint\fP
How many colors to use.  Default 200.  The more colors, the smoother the
transitions will be, and the nicer the resultant images.
.TP 8
.B \-duration \fIseconds\fP
How long to run before choosing a new shape.  Default 30 seconds.
.TP 8
.B \-delay2 \fIseconds\fP
When \fIduration\fP expires, how long to wait before starting a new run.
Default 5 seconds.
.TP 8
.B \-blob
.TP 8
.B \-no\-blob
If \fIblob\fP option is specified, then the raw shapes will be shown, 
instead of a field of colors generated from them.
.TP 8
.B \-fps
Display the current frame rate and CPU load.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.PP
.TP 8
.B DISPLAY
to get the default host and display number.
.TP 8
.B XENVIRONMENT
to get the name of a resource file that overrides the global resources
stored in the RESOURCE_MANAGER property.
