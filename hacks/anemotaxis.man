.SH DESCRIPTION
The program demonstrates a search algorithm designed for locating a
source of odor in turbulent atmosphere. The odor is convected by wind
which has a constant mean direction and fluctuations around it. The
searcher is able to sense the odor and determine local instantaneous
wind direction. The goal is to find the source in the shortest mean
time.  Some animals face this task to find mates, food, home etc. They
exhibit very particular, zigzagging search trajectories.

This is modeled as a search on a discrete two-dimensional lattice. The
source releases particles that drift with constant velocity in one
direction and walk randomly in the other direction. The searcher knows
if it hit a particle, and if so, particle's position one time step
earlier (local wind direction). The program paints sources and
particles released by them as well as trajectories of searchers who are
trying to capture the sources.
