.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fIgoop\fP program draws a simulation of bubbles in layers of 
overlapping multicolored translucent fluid.
.SH OPTIONS
.I goop
accepts the following options:
.TP 8
.B \-window
Draw on a newly-created window.  This is the default.
.TP 8
.B \-root
Draw on the root window.
.TP 8
.B \-mono 
If on a color display, pretend we're on a monochrome display.
.TP 8
.B \-install
Install a private colormap for the window.
.TP 8
.B \-visual \fIvisual\fP
Specify which visual to use.  Legal values are the name of a visual class,
or the id number (decimal or hex) of a specific visual.
.TP 8
.B \-count \fIinteger\fP
How many bubbles to draw per layer.  Default: random.
.TP 8
.B \-planes \fIinteger\fP
How many planes to draw.  Default: random, based on screen depth.
.TP 8
.B \-delay \fImicroseconds\fP
How much of a delay should be introduced between steps of the animation.
Default 12000, or about 0.012 seconds.
.TP 8
.B \-transparent
If \fI\-layers\fP is greater than 1, then each layer will be drawn in one
color, and when they overlap, the colors will be mixed. This is the default.
.TP 8
.B \-non\-transparent
Turns off \fI\-transparent\fP.
.TP 8
.B \-additive
If \fI\-transparent\fP is specified, then this option means that the colors
will be mixed using an additive color model, as if the blobs were projected
light.  This is the default.
.TP 8
.B \-subtractive
If \fI\-transparent\fP is specified, then this option means that the
colors will be mixed using a subtractive color model, as if the blobs were
translucent filters.
.TP 8
.B \-xor
Draw with xor instead of the other color tricks.
.TP 8
.B \-fps
Display the current frame rate and CPU load.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.PP
.TP 8
.B DISPLAY
to get the default host and display number.
.TP 8
.B XENVIRONMENT
to get the name of a resource file that overrides the global resources
stored in the RESOURCE_MANAGER property.
