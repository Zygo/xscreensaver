.SH DESCRIPTION
This screen saver is not meant to look pretty, but rather, to
repair burn-in on LCD monitors.

Believe it or not, screen burn is not a thing of the past.
It can happen to LCD screens pretty easily, even in this modern age.
However, leaving the screen on and displaying high contrast images
can often repair the damage.  That's what this screen saver does.
