This directory contains various graphics hacks.  These are independent from
the xscreensaver program (in the ../driver/ directory) but some of them use
the utility functions found in the ../utils/ directory.

If you have compilation problems, check the parameters in ../config.h.

The file xlock.h makes it really easy to turn `xlock' modules into standalone
programs that can be used with xscreensaver; check it out.
