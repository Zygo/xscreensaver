This directory contains various graphics hacks.  These are independent from
the xscreensaver program (in the ../driver/ directory) but some of them use
the utility functions found in the ../utils/ directory.

If you have compilation problems, check the parameters in ../config.h.

Writing a screen saver?  Make sure you have read ../README.hacking.
