.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fIhyperball\fP program displays a wireframe projection of a hyperball
which is rotating at user-specified rates around any or all of its four axes.
.SH OPTIONS
.I hyperball
accepts the following options:
.TP 8
.B \-window
Draw on a newly-created window.  This is the default.
.TP 8
.B \-root
Draw on the root window.
.TP 8
.B \-mono 
If on a color display, pretend we're on a monochrome display.
.TP 8
.B \-install
Install a private colormap for the window.
.TP 8
.B \-visual \fIvisual\fP
Specify which visual to use.  Legal values are the name of a visual class,
or the id number (decimal or hex) of a specific visual.
.TP 8
.B \-delay \fImicroseconds\fP
How much of a delay should be introduced between steps of the animation.
Default 20000, or about 0.02 seconds.
.TP 8
.B \-xw \fIfloat\fP
.TP 8
.B \-xy \fIfloat\fP
.TP 8
.B \-xz \fIfloat\fP
.TP 8
.B \-yw \fIfloat\fP
.TP 8
.B \-yz \fIfloat\fP
.TP 8
.B \-zw \fIfloat\fP
The amount that the ball should be rotated around the specified axis at
each frame of the animation, expressed in 0.001 radians.  These should be small
floating-point values (less than 50 works best.)  Default: xy=3,
xz=5, yw=10.
.TP 8
.B \-fps
Display the current frame rate and CPU load.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.PP
.TP 8
.B DISPLAY
to get the default host and display number.
.TP 8
.B XENVIRONMENT
to get the name of a resource file that overrides the global resources
stored in the RESOURCE_MANAGER property.
