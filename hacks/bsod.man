NCD X Terminals.
.PP

.SH ENVIRONMENT
.PP
.TP 8
.B DISPLAY
to get the default host and display number.
.TP 8
.B XENVIRONMENT

stored in the RESOURCE_MANAGER property.
.SH X RESOURCES
Notable X resources supported include the following, which control which
hacks are displayed and which aren't.
.BR doWindows ,
.BR doNT ,
.BR doWin2K ,
.BR doWin10 ,
.BR doRansomware ,
.BR doAmiga ,
.BR doMac ,
.BR doMac1 ,
.BR doMacsBug ,
.BR doMacX ,
.BR doSCO ,
.BR doAtari ,
.BR doBSD ,
.BR doLinux ,
.BR doSparcLinux ,
.BR doHPPALinux ,
.BR doBlitDamage ,
.BR doSolaris ,
.BR doHPUX ,
.BR doApple2 ,
.BR doOS390 ,
.BR doTru64 ,
.BR doVMS ,
.BR doMSDOS ,
.BR doOS2 ,
.BR doHVX ,
.BR doVMware ,
and
.BR doATM .
Each of these is a Boolean resource, they all default to true, except
for doAtari, doBSD, doSparcLinux, and doHPPALinux, which are turned off
by default, because they're really not all that interesting looking
unless you're a fan of those systems.  

There are command-line options for all of these:
e.g., \fI\-bsd\fP, \fI\-no-bsd\fP.  (Also note the \fI\-only\fP option.)
.SH BUGS
Unlike the systems being simulated, \fIbsod\fP does not require a
reboot after running.
