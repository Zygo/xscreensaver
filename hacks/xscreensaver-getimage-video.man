.SH NAME
xscreensaver-getimage-video - grab a video still frame for use by screen savers
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B xscreensaver-getimage-video
[\--verbose]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fIxscreensaver\-getimage\-video\fP program is a helper program
for the xscreensaver hacks that manipulate images.  Specifically, it
is invoked by
.BR xscreensaver\-getimage (MANSUFFIX)
as needed.

It grabs a single frame of video from the system's video input to a file,
and prints the name of that file on stdout. It does this by figuring out
which frame-grabbing programs are installed on the system, and invoking the
first one it finds.
.SH OPTIONS
.I xscreensaver-getimage-video
accepts the following options:
.TP 4
.B --verbose
Print diagnostics.
