.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fIjulia\fP program draws spinning, animating julia-set fractals.

It uses ifs {w0 = sqrt(x-c), w1 = -sqrt(x-c)} with random iteration 
to plot the julia set, and sinusoidially varied parameters for the set,
and plots parameters with a circle.

One thing to note is that count is the \fIdepth\fP of the search tree,
so the number of points computed is (2^count)-1.  I use 8 or 9 on a
dx266 and it looks okay.  The sinusoidal variation of the parameter
might not be as interesting as it could, but it still gives an idea 
of the effect of the parameter.

Dragging the mouse in the window uses the mouse's position as the
control point for the generation of ths set.
.SH OPTIONS
.I julia
accepts the following options:
.TP 8
.B \-window
Draw on a newly-created window.  This is the default.
.TP 8
.B \-root
Draw on the root window.
.TP 8
.B \-mono 
If on a color display, pretend we're on a monochrome display.
.TP 8
.B \-install
Install a private colormap for the window.
.TP 8
.B \-visual \fIvisual\fP
Specify which visual to use.  Legal values are the name of a visual class,
or the id number (decimal or hex) of a specific visual.
.TP 8
.B \-ncolors \fIinteger\fP
How many colors should be used (if possible).  Default 200.
The colors used cycle through the hue, making N stops around
the color wheel.
.TP 8
.B \-cycles \fIinteger\fP

.TP 8
.B \-count \fIinteger\fP
.TP 8
.B \-fps
Display the current frame rate and CPU load.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.PP
.TP 8
.B DISPLAY
to get the default host and display number.
.TP 8
.B XENVIRONMENT
to get the name of a resource file that overrides the global resources
stored in the RESOURCE_MANAGER property.
