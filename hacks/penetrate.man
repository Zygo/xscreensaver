.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fIPenetrate\fP simulates the arcade classic with the cities and the stuff
shooting down from the sky and stuff.  The computer plays against itself,
desperately defending the forces of good against those thingies raining
down.  Bonus cities are awarded at ever-increasing intervals.  Every five
levels appears a bonus round.  The computer player gets progressively
more intelligent as the game progresses.  Better aim, more economical with
ammo, and better target selection.  Points are in the bottom right, and
high score is in the bottom left.  Start with -smart to have the computer
player skip the learning process.

.SH BUGS
The layout of the screen isn't quite the same as the game this program
tries to emulate.  In this this program, the missiles come out of the
cities; when really, there are supposed to be three missile bases on
hills, with the cities in the valleys between them.
