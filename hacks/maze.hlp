1 MAZE 
An automated X11 demo repeatedly creating and solving a random maze

SYNOPSIS

 $ maze [-display host:display.screen] [-foreground color] 
        [-background color] [-window] [-root] [-install] [-visual visual] 
        [-grid-size pixels] [-live-color color] [-dead-color color] 
        [-solve-delay usecs] [-pre-delay usecs] [-post-delay usecs]

2 DESCRIPTION
The maze program creates a "random" maze and then solves it with 
graphical feedback. 

2 OPTIONS
Maze accepts the following options:

  -window
Draw on a newly-created window.  This is the default.

  -root
Draw on the root window.

  -install
Install a private colormap for the window.

  -visual visual
Specify which visual to use.  Legal values are the name of a visual class,
or the id number (decimal or hex) of a specific visual.

  -grid-size pixels
The size of each block of the maze, in pixels; default is 0, meaning
pick a random grid size.

  -live-color color
The color of the path.

  -dead-color color
The color of the failed path (it is also stippled with a 50% pattern.)

  -solve-delay integer
Delay (in microseconds) between each step of the solution path.
Default 5000, or about 1/200th second.

  -pre-delay integer
Delay (in microseconds) between generating a maze and starting to solve it.
Default 2000000 (2 seconds.)

  -post-delay integer
Delay (in microseconds) after solving a maze and before generating a new one.
Default 4000000 (4 seconds.)

Clicking the mouse in the maze window controls it.

      LeftButton
Clears the window and restarts maze.

      MiddleButton
Pause or unpause the program.

      RightButton
Exit.

2 BUGS
Expose events force a restart of maze.

Mouse actions are based on "raw" values (Button1, Button2 and Button3)
instead of using the pointer map.

2 ENVIRONMENT
  DISPLAY
to get the default host and display number.

  XENVIRONMENT
to get the name of a resource file that overrides the global resources
stored in the RESOURCE_MANAGER property.
