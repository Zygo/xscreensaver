                             a collection of
                            free screen savers
                            for X11 and MacOS

                            By Jamie Zawinski

===============================================================================

This is the XScreenSaver source code distribution.  It is strongly recommended
that you install a binary release rather than trying to compile it yourself.
Binaries are available for almost all platforms, including MacOS X.  See the
XScreenSaver web site for details.

To compile on a Unix system with X11:

    ./configure
    make
    make install

To compile on MacOS X:

    Use the included XCode project.  Requires XCode 4 and MacOS X 10.5
    or newer.

	* The OSX auto-update installer wasn't working. This time for sure?
	* Various minor fixes.

5.29	* Downgraded to Xcode 5.0.2 to make it possible to build savers

	* `phosphor' and `apple2' can now be run as standalone terminal
	  emulator applications on MacOS.
	* `photopile' sped up.
	* New molecule in `molecule'.
	* "Upgraded" to XCode 4.0, which means that MacOS 10.4 PPC builds are
	  impossible, and Intel is now required.

	  now?

5.14	* Fixed crash in Blank Only Mode when DPMS disabled.
	* Added "Quick Power-off in Blank Only Mode" option.
	* BSOD GLaDOS.

5.13	* Optionally enabled full-scene OpenGL antialiasing.  Set the resource
	  `*multiSample' to true if doing so doesn't kill performance with
	  your video hardware.
	* New version of `glhanoi'.
	* Image-loading hacks that display the file name now also display the

	* When the password dialog has timed out or been cancelled, don't pop
	  it right back up a second time.
	* Password timeouts/cancels don't count as "failed logins".
	* Retired some of the older, less interesting savers: say goodbye to
	  `bubbles', `critical', `flag', `forest', `glforestfire', `lmorph',
	  `laser', `lightning', `lisa', `lissie', `rotor', `sphere', `spiral',
	  `t3d', `vines', `whirlygig', and `worm'.

	* All hacks support the `-fps' option, not just GL ones.
	* The `-fps' option now shows CPU load.

5.06	* Xinerama/RANDR fixes: this time for sure.  It should now work to
	  add/remove monitors or resize screens at any time.
	* New hack, `skytentacles'.
	* New version of `gleidescope'.
	* Added the `-log' option to the xscreensaver daemon, since a truly
	  shocking number of Linux users seem to have no idea how to redirect
	  output to a file.
	* Added `-duration' arg to most image-loading hacks, so that they pick
	  a new image every few minutes.
	* Added an ATM crash to `bsod'.

5.05	* New hacks, `cubicgrid', `hypnowheel', and `lcdscrub' (which isn't
	  really a screen saver).
	* Updates to `m6502' and `gears'.
	* Fixed double-buffering problems in `cubestorm' and `noof'.
	* Better handling of horizontal scroll wheels.
	* Attempt to work around latest Xinerama braindamage: if the server

	  rectangles available.
	* Don't warning about receipt of bogus ClientMessages, since Gnome's
	  just never going to stop sending those.
	* Worked around MacOS 10.5 perl bug that caused the text-displaying
	  hacks to fail on some systems.
	* Hopefully fixed font-related System Preferences crashes in MacOS
	  savers.
	* The recent PAM changes broke the "Caps Lock" warning in the password
	  dialog, the failed login warnings, and syslogging.  Fixed all that.

5.04	* Fixed a possible crash in the unlock dialog (more fallout from the
	  recent PAM changes...)
	* New hacks, `moebiusgears', `abstractile', and `lockward'.
	* Rewrote `gears' to use better (involute) gear models, and to be more
	  random.

	* Added MacOS 10.2 and 10.3 kernel panics to `bsod'.
	* Fixed a Xinerama crash when changing the screen count.
	* New blobbier `mirrorblob'.
	* Minor updates to `lisa', `bsod', `ifs', `hypertorus', `polytopes',
	  `circuit', `endgame', `crackberg', `flipflop', `flipscreen3d',
	  `fliptext', and `carousel'.
	* Enabled multi-threaded OpenGL on MacOS.

5.01	* Backed out recent locale-related changes, since they broke far more
	  things than they fixed.
	* Fail gracefully with ridiculously small window sizes.
	* `xflame' and `flag' ignore bitmap option on MacOS.
	* `speedmine' prefs work on MacOS.
	* Better explosions in `boxed'.
	* More dynamic motion in `sproingies'.
	* More options in `flipflop'.
	* Minor updates to `topblock'.
	* Various other minor fixes.

5.00	* Ported to MacOS X! (10.4.0 or newer)
	* API change: instead of providing a single screenhack() function that
	  does not return, screen savers using the screenhack.h framework must
	  now provide "init" and "draw one frame" functions instead.  All
	  bundled savers have been updated; third-party patches will need
	  work.
	* All image-loading happens asynchronously.
	* xscreensaver-getimage-file caches the contents of the image
	  directory for a few hours, so consecutive runs won't have to re-list
	  the whole directory tree.
	* New hacks, `topblock' and `glschool'.
	* Removed `xteevee' (superceded by `xanalogtv').
	* Added variable-sized puzzle pieces to `jigsaw'.
	* Changes to the defaults and command-line options of many hacks to
	  make the .xml files more consistent.

	* `xmatrix -mode pipe' displays the text of a subprocess.
	* `endgame' has higher resolution chess-piece models.
	* `webcollage' takes a -directory option to get images from a local
	  directory.
	* The RPM spec file no longer auto-restarts xscreensaver when a new
	  version is installed.  Restart it manually.

4.24	* New versions of `cube21', `glsnake', `celtic'.
	* Backed out a DPMS-related patch that cause desktop flickering with
	  some X servers.
	* Fixed startup crash in getgroups() when running setuid.
	* Default to not displaying stderr on the saver window.
	* Fixed bad free() in "Documentation" button.
	* Don't try to run hacks that aren't installed.
	* Minor fixes to various XML config files and man pages.

4.23	* New hacks, `glhanoi', `cube21', `timetunnel', `juggler3d', and
	  `celtic'.
	* New versions of `tangram', `webcollage', `hypertorus', `polytopes',
	  and `ripples'.
	* `sonar' is now quiet about unresolvable hosts.
	* Minor corrections to BASIC code in `apple2'.
	* xscreensaver-demo now provides an RPM clue when none of the hacks
	  seem to be installed.
	* Don't install `ant' by default, since there is some Java tool of
	  that name, which was causing confusion.  And also it's boring.
	* Made screen grabbing work again on MacOS 10.4.2.
	* No longer prints bogus warnings about ClientMessages intended for
	  the window manager.
	* Ignore unprintable characters in passwd entry field.
	* Fixed yet another cross-host-display image-loading endian problem.
	* `xscreensaver-command -watch' and `-time' now work on 64-bit
	  machines.

4.22	* Fixed a bug in the new mouse-motion code that caused the screen to
	  never blank on multi-head non-Xinerama systems.  Oops.
	* New hacks, `interaggregate', `antmaze', `tangram', and `crackberg'.
	* Minor tweaks to `fiberlamp', `ifs', `slidescreen', `zoom', `sonar',
	  `fireworkx', `whirlwindwarp', `bubble3d', and `rd-bomb'.
	* Added motion blur to `blinkbox'.
	* `bsod' now includes Longhorn's "RSOD", and OS/2.
	* Fixed `-wireframe' usage in most hacks and man pages.

4.21	* New hack: `fliptext'.
	* Changed default configure installation directories: /usr/bin/ for
	  xscreensaver, etc.; /usr/libexec/xscreensaver/ for hacks;
	  /usr/share/xscreensaver/config/ for xml files.
	* All the text-manipulating screen savers can have their text source
	  configured via `xscreensaver-demo' now.
	* xscreensaver.spec now builds three RPMs: base (no hacks); extras (2d
	  hacks); and gl-extras.

	* Added `-shells' to `molecule'.
	* Fixed text-alpha glitch in `carousel'.
	* New `pacman': the ghosts can be killed now.
	* Fixed a bug in screen-grabbing GL hacks where images would be tiled
	  instead of scaled on machines that can't do large textures.
	* `webcollage' can hit Flickr now.
	* New (rewritten) implementation of `ifs'.
	* The unlock dialog can be made to have a "New Login" button that will
	  run `gdmflexiserver'.  Experimental!
	* Fixed non-ASCII display bug in `starwars'.
	* Configure finds a default for imageDirectory.
	* "xscreensaver-command -lock" now works even if in "screensaver
	  disabled" mode.
	* If a bad password is typed while CapsLock is on, the unlock dialog
	  says "CapsLock?" instead of "Sorry".
	* Mouse motion only counts as activity if the mouse moved more than 10
	  pixels (so the screen won't unblank every time you bump your desk.)
	* New mode option "random-same": if you have multiple monitors, this
	  will run the *same* randomly chosen hack on each screen, instead of
	  different ones on each.

4.20	* New hacks, `fiberlamp', `boing', `boxfit', and `carousel'.
	* Rewrote `glslideshow' again: should be faster now.
	* Sped up loading of images in GL programs.
	* `starwars' uses texture-mapped fonts now.
	* New `bsod' modes: tru64, hppa, and nvidia.
	* Updates to `webcollage', `juggle', `pinion', `fireworkx', `sonar',
	  `extrusion', `substrate', and `pong'.

	* Minor updates to `sonar', `molecule', `glmatrix', `galaxy', and
	  `webcollage'.

4.17	* New hacks, `anemotaxis' and `memscroller'.
	* Fixed a bad bug that caused `vidwhacker' to never die.
	* Fixed normals and lighting in `polyhedra'.
	* Don't reuse the window when changing hacks (to work around bugs in
	  some GL implementations.)
	* Made `xscreensaver-getimage-file' skip thumbnail-sized images.
	* Fixed endian problem in `barcode' on non-x86.
	* Updates to `webcollage', `apple2', `fuzzyflakes', `atunnel', and
	  `pacman'.
	* Timing tweaks to `bubble3d', `bouncingcow', `engine', `gltext',
	  `lavalite', `molecule', `spotlight', `sballs', `boxed', `blinkbox',
	  and `circuit'.
	* Configure updates for Fedora core 2 / xorg 6.7.0.
	* Compile without warnings under gcc 3.3.3.
	* I give up: don't blank or lock the screen if we can't get a keyboard
	  grab.  In that case, both choices are bad.

4.16	* New hacks, `polyhedra', `fuzzyflakes', `antinspect', and
	  `providence'.
	* Minor updates to `webcollage', `bsod', `endgame', `antspotlight',
	  `xmatrix', and `glmatrix'.
	* Added support for the RANDR (Resize and Rotate) extension to detect
	  when the size of the desktop has been changed while xscreensaver is
	  already running.
	* Possibly-futile attempt to work around "rdesktop" focus/grab idiocy.
	* Made `xscreensaver-getimage -file' still work even if imageDirectory
	  is unset.
	* Convert Latin1 to ASCII in `starwars' and `phosphor' (since the GLUT
	  font only has ASCII glyphs.)
	* Fixed randomization in `noof'.
	* Added "GetViewPortIsFullOfLies" preference to work around
	  longstanding XFree86 bug #421.
	* Made `sonar' subnet pinging work properly on bigendian machines
	  (e.g., PPC.)

4.15	* New hacks, `wormhole', `mismunch', `noof', and `pacman'.
	* `phosphor' and `apple2' include vt100 emulators now: this means you
	  can do "phosphor -program top", or can use either program as an
	  xterm replacement: "apple2 -text -fast -program 'xemacs -nw'".
	* `analogtv' (and related) fill the screen better.
	* The '-gradient' option works in `atlantis' now.
	* Minor updates to `blinkbox', `queens', `endgame', `glmatrix',
	  `mirrorblob', `blocktube', and `molecule'.

	  `gleidescope', `mirrorblob', and `blinkbox'.
	* New version of `glsnake' (with many more models.)
	* Another Windows crash in `bsod'; also HVX/GCOS6/TPS6.
	* New version of `endgame'.
	* Screen grabbing works on MacOS X.
	* Various minor fixes.

4.13	* On Xinerama systems, xscreensaver now runs one hack on each monitor
	  (just like in "real" multi-head mode) instead of running one hack
	  stretching across all the screens.  Note that for this to work with
	  any 3rd party screensavers, they must update their "vroot.h" file.
	* `webcollage' and `vidwhacker' display images using
	  `xscreensaver-getimage' now.
	* Added `ljlatest' script for use with `starwars' and `phosphor'.

	* Updates to `webcollage', `eruption', `jigglypuff', `metaballs', and
	  `endgame'.
	* Completely ignore the `memoryLimit' setting now, since it was still
	  causing people GL grief.
	* Various minor fixes.

4.09	* New hacks, `flyingtoasters', `bouncingcow', `jigglypuff', and
	  `glslideshow'.
	* More models in `engine'.
	* Rewrote `xscreensaver-getimage' to remove reliance on external image
	  loaders (xv, chbg, xloadimage, etc.)  and to reduce flicker when
	  loading files.
	* Made `gflux' and `flipscreen3d' be mouse-spinnable.

4.08	* New hacks, `atunnels' and `piecewise'.
	* Physics improvement in `fluidballs'.
	* Various fixes for XDarwin systems (X11 on MacOS X.)
	* Added -clock option to `barcode'.
	* Minor fixes to `endgame', `flurry', `flipscreen3d', and `gflux'.


4.07	* New hacks, `flurry', `metaballs', `eruption', `popsquares', and
	  `barcode'.
	* Minor updates to `maze' for high density mazes.
	* Added double buffering to `fluidballs' and `whirlygig'.
	* Bug fixes for running xscreensaver to a remote XFree86 display
	  (which nobody would ever do...)
	* Updated `webcollage' (faster Alta Vista searching.)
	* Updated `glplanet' so the sun sets in the west.
	* Updated `sproingies' with smooth, unsegmented surfaces.
	* Fixed Perl version-sensitivity in `xscreensaver-getimage-file'.
	* Fixed GTK2 scrolling bug in `xscreensaver-demo'.

4.06	* New hack, `glblur' (disabled by default, since it requires fast
	  OpenGL texture support.)
	* New hack, `halftone'.
	* Updates to `endgame', `queens', `bumps', `glplanet', `engine', and
	  `circuit'.
	* New version of `menger' that uses far fewer polygons.
	* Fixed minor bug in `critical' that could cause some bogus X servers
	  to crash.
	* Better labels in `molecule': the labels now appear to be attached to
	  the atoms, instead of floating in front of the whole scene.
	* Fixed bug that could rarely cause GL hacks to fail to double-buffer
	  (causing intermittent flickering.)
	* Fixed a relative-URL-parsing bug in `webcollage'.
	* Fixed a bug that (sometimes) caused the window manager close box to
	  kill `xscreensaver-demo' with a crash instead of a graceful exit.
	* Updated xscreensaver.pam to the Red Hat 7.3 way.
	* More Gnome2-related configure crap.
	* Updated to latest `config.guess' and `config.sub'.
	* Fixed occasional core dump in `distort'.
	* Added a Linux fsck failure and kernel panic to `bsod'.
	* Added MacOS X kernel panic to `bsod'.
	* Fixed a bug in `bsod' (all bsod bugs are ironic.)
	* Fixed a bug that caused `xscreensaver-gl-helper' to print a nonsense
	  visual ID with some versions of `printf': this could cause GL
	  programs to display incorrectly (e.g., flickery.)

4.05	* More `configure' tweaks to try and get things working on systems
	  that both Gtk 1.x and 2.x installed.
	* New hack, `endgame'.
	* Minor updates to `gltext'.

4.04	* Support for GTK 2.x / GNOME 2.x.
	* The `configure' script will now use `pkg-config' if you have it, in
	  preference to `gtk-config', etc.
	* New hacks, `lavalite', `queens', and `anemone'.
	* Minor updates to `spheremonics', `gltext', `xmatrix'.
	* You can use the mouse to manually spin most of the GL hacks now
	  (when they are displaying in a window.)
	* Fixed a bug in `webcollage' (due to recent Alta Vista url changes)
	  that was causing it to try and load incorrect image URLs.
	* Made `xscreensaver-getimage' use gdk_pixbuf if it is available: this
	  means that those hacks that load images will no longer rely on "xv",
	  "xloadimage", etc.  This will close a race condition that could
	  sometimes cause your desktop background to be changed; and also
	  makes it possible for those programs to operate on image files when
	  running in windowed mode.
	* `webcollage' can now be used in conjunction with `driftnet' to
	  display images snooped from your local ethernet instead of obtained
	  from search engines.
	* Added man pages for all the hacks that didn't have them.

4.03	* New hack, `spheremonics'.
	* Minor updates to `webcollage', `cage', `moebius', `morph3d',
	  `boxed', `circuit', and `helix'.
	* `pulsar' and `extrusion' can now load texture JPEGs.
	* `rubik' now does non-square cubes.
	* `fluidballs' now does various sizes of balls.
	* `menger' and `sierpinski3d' now also show polygon counts in -fps
	  mode.
	* `molecule' displays real subscripts in the formulae.
	* GTK internationalization/localization support.
	* Better detection of the various versions of libxml.
	* Upgraded to autoconf 2.53 (from 2.13.)

4.02	* Plugged a few minor leaks in `xscreensaver' and `xscreensaver-demo'.
	* New hacks, `cubenetic' and `fluidballs'.
	* Sped up `pipes'.
	* Fixed sphere projection error in `glplanet'; installed a better
	  image of earth.
	* Added Win2K and MacOS 1 crashes to `bsod'.
	* Put back previous (better) version of `forest' that was
	  accidentially downgraded in the last release.
	* New version of `bumps'.
	* Made FPS computation in GL hacks more efficient: it will influence
	  the results less, thus resulting in higher (but more accurate)
	  reported frame rates.

4.01	* New hacks: `twang', `glsnake', `boxed', `sballs', and
	  `glforestfire'.
	* New hacks `apollonian', `euler2d', `juggle', `polyominoes' and
	  `thornbird', from xlockmore.
	* Merged recent xlockmore changes into `ant', `braid', `demon',
	  `discrete', `drift', `fadeplot', `forest', `grav', `hopalong',
	  `ifs', `laser', `lightning', `lisa', `lissie', `loop', `mountain',
	  `penrose', `rotor', `sierpinski', `slip', `sphere', `spiral',
	  `strange', and `vines'.
	* Fixed the `gltext' bug that sometimes caused horizontal lines to
	  vanish again.  This time for sure.
	* Sped up `webcollage' by adding a C helper program to replace the PPM
	  pipeline.  It also pastes images semi-transparently now.
	* Added support for the gdk_pixbuf library: if this lib is available,
	  then `blitspin', `xflame', and `flag' can load GIF, JPEG, and PNG
	  images in addition to XPM and XBM.
	* Fixed a rare race condition where the desktop-grabbing hacks could
	  sometimes leave the screen wedged, if the user moved the mouse
	  exactly when they were grabbing the screen image (it would un-wedge
	  the next time the saver timed out or was activated.)
	* Fixed incorrect colors in the screen-grabbing GL hacks (`gflux' and
	  `flipscreen3d'.)
	* Made SIGHUP restart the daemon process (though using
	  `xscreensaver-command -restart' is still the preferred way.)
	* Tweaks to `xspirograph'.
	* Minor configure and portability tweaks.

4.00	* Redesigned `xscreensaver-demo' GUI: it now includes small-preview
	  and per-hack configuration dialogs.
	* Added three new modes of operation: `One Screen Saver', `Blank
	  Screen', and `Don't Blank' (in addition to the historical `Random
	  Screen Saver').
	* Configure now defaults to installing the hacks in
	  <prefix>/lib/xscreensaver/ instead of <prefix>/bin/.  (Most distros
	  already did it this way.)
	* New GL hacks, `menger', `engine', `flipscreen3d'.
	* Made `sierpinski3d' be more colorful.
	* New versions of `xmatrix' and `nerverot'.
	* Fixed a bug in `starwars' that made the font be drawn with thin
	  lines in -root mode.
	* Fixed a bad colormap bug in `crystal' that could make *subsequent*
	  hacks malfunction!
	* Made `gflux' able to grab screen images (`-mode grab').
	* Updated `webcollage' for recent search engine changes.
	* Removed most command-line options to `xscreensaver': just edit the
	  ~/.xscreensaver file instead.
	* Improved behavior on multi-screen and Xinerama systems: the mouse
	  now stays on the screen where the user left it, and the password and
	  splash dialogs always appear on the screen that has the mouse.
	* Made the splash dialog use more Gtk-like colors; made it have only
	  two buttons, "Settings" and "Help".
	* Made `sonar' understand `.ssh/known_hosts2' format files, and be
	  better about stripping out illegal addresses.

3.34	* Turned `memoryLimit' off by default, sigh.  Apparently some versions
	  of the GL libraries (appear to) allocate hundreds of megs for every
	  GL program, so `memoryLimit' was causing GL programs to malfunction
	  or crash on those systems.
	* Improved fading on TrueColor XFree86 4.1.x systems.
	* New GL hack, `circuit'.
	* Added `fuzz' mode to `decayscreen'.
	* New version of `whirlygig'.
	* Added links to `xplanet' and `sphereEversion'.
	* Fixed rare race condition that could make `sonar' hang.
	* Fixed potential crash in `speedmine'.
	* Made `xscreensaver-demo' not crash when imageDirectory was set to a
	  non-existent directory.
	* Made `xscreensaver-getimage-video' invoke XawTV's `streamer' program
	  better.
	* Made `phosphor' and `starwars' deal with CR, LF, or CRLF line
	  endings.
	* Changes for Cygwin compilation environments.
	* Made `sonar' compile on systems that can't ping.
	* Configure changes for HPUX 10.20.
	* Made PAM code work on Red Had 4.2 systems.
	* Made `xscreensaver-command -deactivate' work when the saver is not
	  active: what that does is reset the idle timer, as if keyboard input
	  had been detected.  This was added for the benefit of people writing
	  DVD-playing software: they can now prevent the screensaver from
	  kicking in by sending a -deactivate message once a minute while the
	  movie is playing and not paused.
	* Various minor portability tweaks.

3.33	* New hacks, `speedmine' and `whirlygig'.
	* Sped up `pyro', made the explosions look a bit better.
	* Added better stars to `glplanet' and `starwars'.
	* Many internal changes to `webcollage'.
	* Some new options to `attraction'.
	* Minor fix to `noseguy' to avoid un-erased pixels.
	* Rewrote the screen-eraser effects so that they complete in the same
	  amount of time regardless of how slow your X server is (some of them
	  were glacial on servers with slow blitting.)
	* Fixed a potential free memory reference that could sometimes cause a
	  crash at startup.
	* Possibly fixed a problem that could cause the daemon to crash with
	  an X error.  I was never able to reproduce this problem, but I think
	  I might have figured out what caused it.
	* Worked around a problem that caused PAM authentication to fail on
	  some Red Hat 7.x systems.
	* Added a `memoryLimit' parameter that controls the amount of memory a
	  graphics hack may allocate: if they try to allocate more than this,
	  malloc() will fail (and they will exit or (safely) crash, rather
	  than hogging memory.)  Default is 50M.
	* Made `gnome-help-browser' be the default way to display man pages in
	  `xscreensaver-demo', if running on a GNOME system.

3.32	* The image-manipulating hacks (`slidescreen', etc.) can now operate
	  on randomly chosen image files from disk, or on frames captured from
	  the system's video input, instead of (or in addition to)
	  manipulating images of the desktop.
	* Rewrote `vidwhacker' to use the new image-grabbing mechanism.
	* Made fading work on TrueColor XFree86 4.x systems.
	* Fixed a subtle rendering bug in `atlantis' (the fish were inside
	  out!)
	* Made `atlantis' have a texture simulating light reflections from the
	  surface of the ocean.
	* Fixed up label placement in `molecule'.
	* Better color bars in `xteevee'.
	* Made `install-strip' not try to strip scripts.

3.31	* Put in more sensible defaults for DPMS, and updated the
	  documentation to reflect the fact that all your DPMS settings are
	  now belong to xscreensaver.
	* Fixed the `xscreensaver.spec' file so that `--force' is no longer
	  needed.
	* New versions of `rotzoomer' and `nerverot'.
	* Fixed an OSF/1 compilation problem in `molecule'.

3.30	* New hacks, `molecule', `dangerball', and `rotzoomer'.
	* New version of `gflux'.
	* Made `gltext' able to display the current time.
	* Fixed a floating-point-precision problem in `gltext' that sometimes
	  caused horizontal lines to vanish.
	* Removed the `-window-id' option from the hacks: it never worked
	  right, and was unnecessary.
	* Made the `starwars' hack use thicker lines, antialias the text, and
	  fade out at the far edge instead of just dropping off.
	* Fixed an SHM segment leak in `moire'.

3.29	* Better rendering of the new logo.
	* New hack, `gltext'.
	* Added `-planetary' option to `gears', to draw a different kind of
	  gear system.
	* Made motion and rotation be smoother in `gears', `glplanet',
	  `moebius', `rubik', and `sierpinski3d'.
	* Improved coloration in `sierpinski3d'.
	* Made the GL hacks react to window size changes.
	* Made most of the GL hacks take a -fps option (like `pulsar' did), so
	  you can use them to benchmark your 3D hardware.
	* Fixed the previous fix to `sonar'.
	* Minor fix to `nerverot'.  Made sonar able to ping hosts on DEC OSF1.
	* Eliminated a bogus "didn't get enough colors" warning in some of the
	  hacks.

3.28	* New logo for xscreensaver!
	* New hacks, `starwars' and `stonerview'.
	* Made the motion of the bouncing ball in `stairs' be a little less
	  jerky.
	* Made newly-added screenhacks be added to .xscreensaver
	  automatically: if there are hacks in the app-defaults file that are
	  not also in ~/.xscreensaver, they will be added to the end of the
	  list.
	* Redid the `Screensaver Options' part of the control panel;
	  xscreensaver now lets you configure your DPMS settings.
	* Fixed some Makefile problems with non-GL builds.
	* Fixed detection of MesaGL for version 3.3.
	* Better workaround to Red Hat 7.0's broken gcc.
	* Added Sparc Solaris kernel panic to `bsod'.

3.27	* New hacks: `zoom' and `whirlwindwarp'.
	* Fixed a free-memory-reference bug in `sonar'.
	* Better error handling when there are no suitable GL visuals.
	* Added diagnostic dialog when xscreensaver-demo is unable to launch
	  xscreensaver (e.g., when running as root.)
	* Fixed a bug that caused screenhack argument changes to be ignored
	  when xscreensaver-demo was running as root (if "root" and "nobody"
	  have different home directories.)
	* Made the programs default to ":0" if $DISPLAY is unset.
	* Made the `-verbose' output include information about which server
	  extensions were supported at compile time.
	* Worked around Red Hat 7.0's broken gcc 2.96.
	* Updated default delays on the GL hacks to look better on machines
	  with super-fast 3D hardware.
	* Install `screensaver-properties-capplet' to work around the usual
	  egregious GNOME lossage.

3.26	* Added "enabled" checkboxes in the list of hacks in xscreensaver-demo
	  (Gtk version only.)
	* New hacks `hyperball', `xrayswarm', and `gflux'.
	* New versions of `nerverot', `galaxy', and `hypercube'.
	* Small fixes to `phosphor', `shadebobs', `xflame', and `sonar'.
	* Added external helper program `xscreensaver-gl-helper' to figure out
	  which X visual to use for OpenGL programs.
	* Configure updates for XFree86 4.0, and for BSD.
	* Made it be more tolerant of bogus /etc/group files.
	* When installing the PAM config file, first try to just copy an
	  existing "xdm" or "login" config file, so that xscreensaver does
	  authentication in the same way as the rest of the system.

3.25	* New hack, `nerverot'.
	* Added BSD kernel panic to `bsod'.
	* New version of `shadebobs'.
	* New version of `petri'.
	* Updated `webcollage' to handle recent Altavista URL format changes;
	  made it search the AP photo gallery.
	* Revamped command-line options of `sonar' and made it properly handle
	  subnets.
	* The `bubbles' hack can now trickle up or down the screen.
	* The `xsublim' hack can now read its text from programs.
	* Support for GLE version 3 in `extrusion'.
	* Fixed compilation problems in `maze'.
	* Fixed a rare crash in `flow'.
	* Fixes for minor installation problems.

3.24	* Added `-ignorant' option to `maze' hack.
	* Updates to `critical', `bsod', `xflame', and `flow'.
	* Added support for Kerberos 5 (via its Kerberos 4 compatibility
	  layer.)
	* Fixed a bad leak in `xteevee'.
	* Updated `webcollage' to handle recent Altavista URL format changes.
	* Removed xscreensaver-demo's `Ok' and `Cancel' buttons, since they
	  were confusing people: all changes are now instantanious.
	* Made xscreensaver-demo install itself into the Gnome Control Center.

3.23	* Fixed some misplaced text fields in the Motif version of
	  xscreensaver-demo; fixed a crash in the Gtk version that would
	  happen if the programs list was empty.
	* Fixed a recently-introduced bug in `pulsar'.
	* Made `sierpinski3d' use solid tetrahedrons instead of points.
	* Added `-trace' option to `xmatrix'.
	* Added new hacks `xteevee' and `xspirograph'.

3.22	* Fixed some bugs in xscreensaver-demo.
	* Rewrote the Motif version of xscreensaver-demo to match the new Gtk
	  version.
	* The Athena toolkit is no longer supported.

3.21	* Tweaked the xscreensaver-demo UI (Gtk only.)
	* Fixed a few visual selection bugs.  I think the proper GL visual
	  should be used with nVidia systems now.
	* Made the Makefiles obey $install_prefix.
	* Made the `xscreensaver.spec' file able to generate both GL and
	  non-GL packages simultaneously.

3.20	* Added new hacks `ripples' and `sierpinski3d'.
	* Made `xscreensaver-command -exit' be silent when no screen saver was
	  running (instead of complaining.)
	* Made `webcollage' and `vidwhacker' use `xloadimage' when available
	  (in addition to `xli' and `xv'.)
	* Improved memory usage in `petri' and gave it a hard cap on how much
	  memory it can allocate.
	* Added `-watch' option to `xscreensaver-command'.
	* Made `xscreensaver-demo' come up with the most-recently-run hack
	  selected by default.
	* Rewrote the Gtk version of `xscreensaver-demo'.  It's a lot easier
	  to use now.
	* Extended the format of the programs list in the .xscreensaver file,
	  for the benefit of the new capabilities of `xscreensaver-demo'.
	  NOTE: you might want to delete your ~/.xscreensaver file and allow
	  it to be re-created!  The old one should still work, but
	  xscreensaver-demo won't be as pretty.

3.19	* Fixed gcc dependencies in `bumps' and `ccurve'.
	* New hack, `extrusion'.
	* Some of the web sites that `webcollage' was using as its sources
	  changed formats; tweaked it to understand the current layouts.
	* Added typeahead in the password dialog: if the screen is locked, and
	  you unlock it by typing a character, that key will be automatically
	  inserted in the password dialog (unless it is Return, Enter, Space,
	  or a non-printing key like Shift.)
	* Made `xmatrix' take a `-small' option, since some folks with tiny
	  screens prefer a smaller font.

3.18	* New versions of `shadebobs', `lmorph', and `distort'.
	* Added `ccurve', `blaster', and `bumps' hacks.
	* Replaced `forest' hack with a rewritten version.
	* Worked around a Xinerama server bug.
	* Fixed a bug I introduced in 3.10 that caused some hacks to print out
	  superfluous warnings about not having gotten enough colors.
	* Made `sproingies' obey the `-delay' option.
	* Fixed a portability bug in `shadebobs'.
	* Made `webcollage' and `vidwhacker' use `xli' in preference to `xv',
	  if it is available.
	* Added a new source of images to `webcollage'.
	* If running under KDE, xscreensaver will add itself to KDE's list of
	  screensavers (via xscreensaver.kss.)
	* Improved detection of GL libraries.
	* Made the password dialog include the date and time.

3.17	* New version of `webcollage' -- deals better with corrupted images,
	  and can use an http proxy.
	* New hack, `xsublim' (run it in the background, rather than adding it
	  to the programs list.)
	* The xscreensaver daemon was leaking a file descriptor each time you
	  edited your .xscreensaver file.  Fixed.

3.16	* New version of `shadebobs'.
	* Improved image selection in `webcollage', and sped it up slightly.
	* Made configure find the right version of perl.
	* Rewrote the CGI part of `webcollage'.
	* `make clean' was deleting some things it shouldn't.
	* Fixed a typo in the default programs list.

3.15	* Added `webcollage' and `shadebobs' hacks.
	* Added a `-stdout' arg to `vidwhacker' so that it can be used in a
	  pipeline.
	* Made `petri' use less memory.

3.14	* Various improvements to the Gtk port.
	* Turned off PAM by default on Solaris, since PAM seems generally to
	  be misconfigured out-of-the-box.
	* Made the `--without-gtk' configure option work.
	* Made configure check the Gtk version number, since it requires 1.2.
	* Fixed a bug in the code that attempted to prevent changes of screen
	  resolution while the screen is locked.
	* Fixed a race condition in `xscreensaver-demo' that could cause an X
	  error at startup.
	* Added `-transparent' option to `deluxe'.
	* Added `petri' hack.

3.13	* Ported `xscreensaver-demo' to Gtk.
	* Made it possible to build Motif, Gtk, and Athena versions of
	  `xscreensaver-demo' in the same directory without reconfiguring.
	* Made `xscreensaver-demo' chase symlinks before writing the
	  .xscreensaver file, so that if .xscreensaver is itself a symlink,
	  the underlying file will be replaced instead.
	* Some Makefile and configure tweaks for Solaris and FreeBSD.
	* Made it possible to set the fire color in `xflame'.
	* Made transparency work in TrueColor (for `goop' and `qix'.)
	* Fixed a multi-head bug introduced by the virtual viewports stuff.


3.12	* Made it so that you can't scroll the screen while the lock dialog is
	  up (with XFree86 virtual viewports.)
	* Fixed a bug in `flag' that caused bob's chin to get cut off after a
	  few iterations.

3.11	* Made `xjack' be black-on-white-ish, so that it looks less like a
	  computer screen and more like the typewritten paper it's supposed to
	  be.
	* New version of `pulsar'.
	* Fixed Solaris compilation problem in `phosphor'.
	* Made xscreensaver notice XFree86's virtual root window hack, so that
	  if the X server's root window is larger than the monitor's
	  displayable resolution, the screen saver will limit itself to the
	  area that actually appears on the screen.
	* Made the xscreensaver daemon do a better job of picking the visual
	  class that should be used for GL programs.  Less user intervention
	  should be needed now: you can use the logical visual name `GL'
	  instead of having to figure out by hand which one to use.
	* Oops, the visual was defaulting to "best" instead of
	  "default", because the .xscreensaver file was not being
	  loaded quite early enough.
	* Made configure figure out how to build icmp ping support into the
	  `sonar' hack automatically.
	* Made warnings about not being able to read shadow passwords not be
	  printed if compiled with PAM support.
	* Improved PAM startup diagnostics.
	* Worked around the Solaris PAM bug that was causing crashes there, so
	  now PAM is turned on by default.
	* Made configure detect the number of arguments that pam_strerror()
	  takes, since on Linux, this apparently changed between 2.0 and 2.2,
	  sigh.
	* Made the /proc/interrupts kludge look for "PS/2 Mouse" as well as
	  "keyboard".
	* Made xscreensaver notice when there has been a sudden large jump in
	  wall-clock time, and if so, lock right away, instead of waiting for
	  "lockTimeout" to expire first.  (Laptops need this for safer
	  recovery from ``hibernation.'')
	* Added `-throttle' option to `xscreensaver-command'.

3.10	* Added `phosphor', `xmatrix', and `pulsar' hacks.
	* Fixed a bug in the color allocator that sometimes caused `starfish'
	  to fall back to monochrome.
	* Reduced the amount of code that runs before root privileges are
	  disavowed: "normal" and "shadow" passwords now do some
	  initialization as root, but the PAM and Kerberos authorization
	  schemes will be initialized while running as "nobody".  Supposedly
	  this closes a potential security hole when using Kerberos.
	* Added some more sanity checking to configure.

3.09	* Added `compass', `squiral', `xflame', `wander', `spotlight', and
	  `critical' hacks.
	* Added some new modes to `decayscreen'.
	* Made `deluxe' work in monochrome.
	* Generalized usage of the Double-Buffer server extension in several
	  hacks (`compass', `deluxe', `interference', `kumppa', and `moire2'.)
	* Fixed another visual-depth problem in `rd-bomb'.
	* The screen saver will now defer blanking if neither the keyboard nor
	  the mouse could be grabbed.  Instead, it will just try again in a
	  few minutes.  This fixes a bad interaction between xscreensaver and
	  programs like VMware that hold the mouse and keyboard grabbed for a
	  long time.
	* Added a new erase mode (expanding spiral.)

3.08	* Fixed some bugs in my port of `t3d'.
	* Added `penetrate' and `deluxe' hacks.
	* When linking against Motif 2.x, also link against XPM.
	* Added support for using /proc/interrupts for idle detection on
	  Linux.  Now xscreensaver shouldn't kick in when the user is active
	  on a non-X virtual console.
	* Upgraded to autoconf 2.13.

3.07	* Configure tweaks (sometimes -lXmu wasn't getting linked in properly;
	  check for _Xsetlocale in -lXintl.)
	* Portability fixes for sonar.c.
	* Fixed a compilation problem when you have GL but don't have XPM.
	* Made configure notice when MesaGL requires -lpthread.
	* Made `flame' ignore SIGFPE (not sure if this is the right fix; it
	  seems only to be needed on FreeBSD.)
	* Kludged `rd-bomb' work on visuals that are of depth 24 but that *do
	  not* support pixmaps of depth 32.
	* Fixed `halo' to work properly in TrueColor.
	* Changed `xscreensaver.spec' to install the hacks in
	  /usr/X11R6/lib/xscreensaver/ by default, since that's where recent
	  Red Hat distributions put them.
	* Added `t3d' hack.
	* Updated versions of `crystal', `hopalong', and `flow' from
	  xlockmore.
	* Imported `demon' and `loop' modes from xlockmore.

3.06	* Oops, the "default-n" visual descriptor was broken; it was always
	  installing a colormap if the `installColormap' preference was set,
	  meaning that `xearth', `xv' and friends were using the wrong colors
	  on 8-bit systems.
	* Turned off HAVE_PING in `sonar', since it compiles on some Linux
	  systems, but not others of similar vintage...

3.05	* Fixed an off-by-1 in `distort'.
	* Added `sonar' hack.
	* New version of `glplanet' (with stars.)
	* Made all hacks exit when you type `q' or `ESC' at them, and made
	  them obey the WM_DELETE_WINDOW ClientMessage.
	* Fixed a nonfatal buffer overrun in lament (note: lament still
	  doesn't work with MesaGL 3.0: it dies in
	  lambda_textured_triangle1(), which is Mesa's bug, not mine.)

3.04	* Added an `xscreensaver.spec' file, to make it easier for other folks
	  to generate RPMs.
	* Made the password code work on HPUX in the situation where:
	  ``enhanced security'' is available; but not used; but the user typed
	  a password more than 8 characters long anyway.  FTSOHPUX.

3.03	* Made locking work when passwd aging is enabled.
	* Added support for PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules.)  It is
	  still turned off by default, though, since it doesn't seem to work
	  on Solaris 2.6, and has been behaving erratically on Red Hat 5.1.
	* Made each possible authentication method be tried in turn until one
	  succeeds; this means that Kerberos is being used, we will first
	  check Kerberos, and if that fails, will then consult the local
	  password file.  Likewise with PAM.
	* Save and restore the bits under the passwd dialog, to avoid leaving
	  a black rectangle behind when unlocking is cancelled.

3.02	* Not everyone has sys/select.h, sigh...

3.01	* Some fixes to `reflect'.
	* Configure tweaks.
	* Made it log unsuccessful attempts to unlock the screen to syslog.
	* Fixed a bug where `xscreensaver-demo' could be seeing a different
	  programs list than `xscreensaver' did.

3.00	* The xscreensaver daemon no longer links against Motif or Athena:
	  demo-mode and the preferences panel are no longer built in to the
	  daemon, but are now handled by an external program,
	  `xscreensaver-demo'.  (I decided that this, along with the recent
	  addition of the `.xscreensaver' config file, justified bumping the
	  version number to 3.00, since this is a fairly major architectural
	  change.)
	* Lines in the `*programs' resource may now begin with the character
	  "-", meaning "don't run this hack."  In this way, it's possible to
	  disable a hack without throwing away the information about it
	  (making it easier to change your mind later.)  Eventually the
	  preferences/demo mode GUI should represent this as a checkbox or
	  something.
	* Fixed a short race condition where it was possible for xscreensaver
	  to die with a BadWindow error if it was blanking the screen just as
	  another window was being deleted.
	* Made it possible to disable specific modes in `bsod'.

2.34	* Fixed a bug that was making `pipes' generate way too many valves.
	  Made the viewpoint in `pipes' be selected randomly instead of always
	  being -10 degrees.
	* Fixed a bug in the XSHM code, in the case where the server supports
	  the XSHM extension but is not the same machine as the client.
	* Made `rd-bomb' default to taking up the whole screen.
	* Made it not try to do fading/unfading if no PseudoColor visuals
	  exist.
	* Initial attempt at supporting VT-locking (doesn't work yet.)
	* Eliminated the `captureStdout' resource; now `captureStderr'
	  controls both streams.
	* Added `-capture-stderr' and `-no-capture-stderr' command-line
	  arguments.
	* Added `glplanet' hack.
	* When a hack is selected with `xscreensaver-command -select', that
	  hack will be used until further notice (until the saver turns off,
	  or another activation command is issued.)

2.33	* Made `xscreensaver-command' print error messages: the xscreensaver
	  daemon now responds to ClientMessage events by writing a response
	  message on a window property, instead of just writing to its stderr.
	* Made the ~/.xscreensaver file be automatically reloaded when the
	  file date changes.
	* The password dialog and splash screen no longer depend on Motif or
	  Athena.  This should clear up a number of focus problems, and is the
	  first step on the path toward moving all of the
	  Motif/Athena/whatever code out of the xscreensaver daemon, and into
	  external processes.
	* Don't complain about LessTif 0.86 any more, since the new password
	  dialog makes that problem go away.
	* Configure tweaks for Irix 6.5, SunOS 5.something.
	* New `-reflect' option to `distort'.

2.32	* Added reading and writing of a ~/.xscreensaver file, so that the
	  Preferences panel can save its settings.
	* New version of `rubik'.
	* Added `-select N' argument to `xscreensaver-command'.
	* Oops, left out some of the `bubbles3d' files...

2.31	* The cursor was invisible in the password dialog. Fixed.
	* Made configure warn against MesaGL 2.6.
	* Fixed X error at startup when using non-default visual.
	* New version of `crystal', `ant', and `atlantis' from xlockmore.
	* New hack, `bubble3d'.
	* Added some new modes to `bsod'.

2.30	* Changed the order in which -lSM and -lICE are linked to be after
	  Motif instead of before (Lesstif on Irix needs this.)

2.29	* Work around a bash bug in configure.
	* Tweaked HPUX paths again.  FTSOHPUX.
	* Made configure recommend against LessTif 0.86, due to a bug in that
	  version that causes a security hole in the screen locking code.
	  LessTif 0.87 will fix it.
	* Made all of the `--with' options to `configure' accept a directory
	  option as well (so that --with-motif=/FOO will add -I/FOO/include
	  -L/FOO/lib).  I believe this is the Configure Party Line of how do
	  to such things.
	* Fixed a bug where the mouse was left un-grabbed after the first time
	  the graphics hack was changed (simplified all of the mouse-grabbing
	  logic.)
	* Maybe possibly perhaps made `vidwhacker' really not leave stray xv
	  windows around.  This time for sure.
	* Added a new erase mode (random dots fizzling out.)
	* Added `-prefs' argument to `xscreensaver-command', that brings up
	  the Preferences dialog directly (it seems that nobody ever noticed
	  the `Preferences' button on the Demo Mode dialog, maybe this will
	  help.)
	* Added a splash screen.  Turn it off with *splash:false.

2.28	* Better macsbug text in `bsod'.
	* New version of `distort' with many new modes.
	* Plugged a leak in `coral'.
	* Tweaked configure for HPUX.
	* Removed some compiler warnings.
	* More consistent usage of stderr versus stdout.
	* More diagnostics should an X error occur.
	* Fixed a possible crash in SGI-specific unfading code.

2.27	* Improved version of `distort'.
	* Made `lament' compile against OpenGL 1.0 (though it still requires
	  1.1 to work properly.)
	* Updated my email address and home page.

2.25	* Improved motion in `rd-bomb'.
	* Added XSHM (shared memory extension) support to the `distort',
	  `interference', `moire', `rd-bomb', and `swirl' hacks, which speeds
	  them up a bit.
	* Added `lament' hack.

2.24	* Tweaked the order of the -L options again.
	* Cleaned up configure's `--help' message.
	* Added `kumppa' hack.
	* Smarter maze-solving algorithm in `maze'.
	* Took `xlyap' out of the default list of hacks, since it's just
	  incredibly buggy (and slow.)  Maybe someday someone will fix it...
	* Added `distort' hack, but didn't add it to the default list (yet)
	  because it's still too slow.
	* Made the Athena demo dialog look more like the Motif version; it has
	  a text-entry field now, too.
	* Made the Athena password dialog echo asterisks, like Motif does,
	  instead of using a flyspeck font.
	* Some random configure tweaks.
	* Added a `timestamp' resource that makes the `-verbose' messages
	  include the time at which they were printed.

2.23	* The fix for SGI's ``scheme'' nonsense broke things, and let the
	  user's "*background" resource show through.  Fixed it in a different
	  way.

2.22	* Added support for the DPMS server extension (Display Power
	  Management System.)
	* Made configure advertize the `--enable-subdir' option a little more,
	  since that seemed to cause some people stress.  Also, made that
	  directory be built into the xscreensaver executable, as a hardcoded
	  prefix to $PATH.  (Might help, shouldn't hurt.)
	* Made configure prefer the two-arg gettimeofday to the one-arg
	  version, since AIX doesn't have any prototypes.
	* Made it work with Xaw3d (the 3D Athena library.)
	* Made `make install' create directories as necessary.
	* New version of lmorph from Sverre.
	* Added `crystal' and `discreet' hacks from xlockmore.
	* Added a new mode to `bsod'.

2.21	* Made `xscreensaver-command -time' use different words.  (It now
	  describes the two states as "screen blanked since..."  and "screen
	  non-blanked since..." instead of "active since..." and "inactive
	  since..." which a lot of people interpreted as meaning the opposite
	  of what was intended.)
	* Improved some error messages, in the hopes of making the distinction
	  between the xscreensaver and xscreensaver-command programs more
	  obvious.
	* Rewrote (and reorganized) parts of the xscreensaver and
	  xscreensaver-command manual pages.
	* Renamed xscreensaver's `-lock' command-line option to be
	  `-lock-mode', to avoid confusion with the `-lock' option to
	  xscreensaver-command, which does a totally different thing.
	* Removed xscreensaver's `-demo' command-line option for a similar
	  reason; use `xscreensaver-command -demo' instead.
	* Disabled SGI's ``scheme'' nonsense in a better way than
	  fully-qualifying the background colors in every single hack.
	* Fixed some other minor cosmetic problems when *sgiMode is turned on.
	* Fixed an X error in `bsod -root' (how ironic...)

2.20	* Fixed a bug that caused the mouse to sometimes not be grabbed
	  properly (meaning the window manager menu could pop up over the
	  demo-mode display.)
	* Fixed a bug that made the stderr output sometimes get printed twice.
	* Fixed a bug that made the demo-mode scrollbar move too fast.
	* Protected against a possible buffer overflow.
	* Made `vidwhacker' not leave stray xv windows around.
	* New version of `ant' so that Bagley doesn't calve.
	* Make configure on AIX get XShm from the right library.

2.19	* One file was missing from the tar file.

2.18	* Oops, atlantis wasn't being built by default.
	* Added `epicycle' hack.
	* Added `interference' hack.
	* Added `truchet' hack.
	* Added `bsod' hack.
	* Added some new modes to `vidwhacker'.

2.17	* Added a -window-id argument to most hacks, so that they can draw on
	  arbitrary externally-provided windows.
	* Synched with xlockmore 4.11a01.
	* Added `flow' hack.
	* Added `atlantis' GL hack.
	* Renamed `puzzle' hack to `jigsaw', since xlock already had a
	  different mode called `puzzle'.
	* Made it self-configure properly when Motif 2.1.0 is being used
	  (requires -lXp now, sigh...)

2.16	* Made `flag' able to do XPM images.
	* New look for the xscreensaver logo (`xroger').
	* Fixed compilation error on Suns with adjunct passwords.
	* Got multi-architecture builds working again.
	* Some configure tweaks for building on HPUX and Solaris.
	* Fixed bug in decayscreen.
	* Fixed typo in passwd.c.
	* Made `cynosure' not die when colormap is full.

2.15	* Added `cynosure' hack.
	* Added `moire2' hack.
	* Tweaked `erase.c' some more.
	* Made unfading a bit smoother.
	* Added `vidwhacker' hack (not installed by default.)
	* Added `stairs' hack.
	* Split `escher' into `cage' and `moebius', as per xlockmore.
	* Changed subprocess handling to use sigaction() instead of signal()
	  if it's available (this is necessary for SCO but should work fine on
	  other systems too.)
	* Various other tweaks.

2.14	* Better fix for the Motif drag-and-die lossage.
	* Put in some kludges to work around a LessTif bug.
	* XScreenSaver is known to work with LessTif 0.82 now.
	* Made fading work on high-end SGI video hardware.
	* Fixed another SGI-specific bug in screen grabbing; will the madness
	  never cease?
	* Fixed another crash in `xlyap'.

2.13	* Made `decayscreen' do directions other than down.
	* Improved `puzzle'.
	* Fixed a crash in `xlyap'.
	* Added CDE info to the man page, removed `cde.txt'.
	* Configure tweaks for Zippy.
	* Turned off the signal handling in `bubbles' because it was sometimes
	  failing to die.
	* Added `hacks/xscreensaver-sgigl.c' to make it possible to run SGI's
	  ElectroPaint hack (/usr/demos/bin/ep) with xscreensaver.  Finally!
	* Fixed a buffer overrun in the locking code that some wily, malicious
	  cracker must have slipped in.
	* Disabled Motif drag-and-drool in the dialog box buttons, since it's
	  broken in some old versions of Motif.

2.12	* Added `README.debugging'.
	* Added `puzzle' hack.
	* Added `xlyap' hack.
	* Added `default-n' as a visual name, so that one can have -install on
	  by default, but turn it off for certain poorly-behaved hacks (like
	  xv.)
	* Added support for grabbing frames of external video (on SGI) to the
	  screen-grabbing hacks (decayscreen, slidescreen, slip, blitspin, and
	  puzzle.)
	* Improved look of tiles in `slidescreen'; fixed its color allocation
	  problem.

2.11	* Tweaked `blitspin', added it to the default list.
	* Added `lissie', `mountain', `triangle', `worm', `rotor', and `ant'
	  from xlockmore.
	* Updated `sierpinski', `galaxy', and `lisa'.
	* Thickened the lines in `braid' and `lmorph'.
	* Updated VMS makefiles.
	* Renamed `fract' to `vines'.
	* Added `xjack' hack.
	* Made a few more hacks use erase.c, and added a few more wipe styles.
	* Fixed compilation problem with Sun's version of OpenGL.
	* Added ability to use sigaction() instead of signal()
	  to work around a SCO kernel bug.

2.10	* Fixed colormap bugs in `rd-bomb'; sped up `coral'.
	* Configure tweaks for *BSD.

2.08	* New hacks `rd-bomb' and `coral'.
	* New version of `maze' with some new algorithms.
	* New colorized version of `rocks'.
	* Fixed a bug in qix on 64-bit machines.
	* Fixed a bug in the -time option.
	* Fixed a bug in configure related to LessTif.

2.07	* Minor header tweaks in windows.c and flag.c.
	* Made multi-architecture ($VPATH) builds work properly.
	* Merged new GL stuff from xlockmore (rubik, morph3d.)
	* Fixed intermittent crashes in `imsmap' and `munch'.
	* Added `fadeplot' hack from xlockmore.

2.06	* Merged in VMS support from Patrick Moreau.

2.05	* Fixed a MIT-SCREEN-SAVER-related crash, and tweaked
	  configure to detect the extra-random -Xss library.

2.04	* HP configure tweaks.  Detect and warn about LessTif.
	* Fixed low-color behavior of `goop', `pyro', `starfish',
	  `greynetic', `flame', `halo', and `moire'.

2.03	* Fixed flicker in `pipes'.  Fixed 3d in `bouboule'.
	* Added `munch' hack.
	* Added basic dependencies to the Makefile.in files.

2.02	* Fixes for compiling with the MIT saver extension.
	* Made the yow/fortune program be a configure option.
	* Various configure tweaks.

2.01	* Added `goop' and `starfish' hacks.
	* Added colomap cycling to `halo'.
	* Made `attraction' use the new colormap allocator.
	* Added better $PATH diagnostics.
	* There was a bug in frand!  Color selection should be much improved
	  now.

2.00	* Converted to use `configure' instead of `imake'.
	* ANSI C is now required.
	* Added Kerberos locking support, from Nat Lanza.
	* Made the stderr text use overlay planes, if possible.
	* Reworked the xlockmore compatibility stuff again.
	* Added `gears', `superquadrics', `escher', `pipes', and `sproingies'
	  hacks (depend on OpenGL.)

1.34	* Fixed some bugs, made fading be a little smoother.

1.33	* Made it work with multi-headed displays.
	* Generalized sub-process management (Unix sucks!)
	* Added interactive mouse frobbing to Julia.
	* Added (untested) support for HPUX shadow passwords.
	* Made normal non-shadow passwords be checked if the shadow passwords
	  aren't accessible for some reason.

1.32	* Removed *colorPrograms and *monoPrograms resources: made it possible
	  to specify the desired visual on a per-hack basis.
	* Cleaned up / restructured the driver: no more globals.
	* Made the Motif and Athena dialogs share more code.
	* Probably fixed some Athena colormap-installation bugs.
	* Fixed screen grabbing (cmap) on SGI 12-bit PseudoColor.
	* Fixed divide-by-zero in bright random colormaps.
	* Added an improved version of xlock's `flag' hack.
	* Made unfading work better, and not flicker on SGIs.
	* Added `sphere', `forest', `lisa' hacks from xlockmore.
	* Added (untested) support for SunOS Adjunct passwords.

1.31	* Improved colors and colormap cycling of many hacks.
	* Cleaned up xlockmore compatibility layer.
	* Made `blitspin' able to grab an image off the screen.
	* Ported `swirl' and `bouboule' hacks from xlockmore.
	* Made the driver more careful about not leaving bits on the screen,
	  or allowing other windows to raise themselves: it now re-blanks the
	  screen every so often.
	* Added `-time' option to `xscreensaver-command'.
	* Improved SGI screen-grabbing some more: now it can grab TrueColor
	  screens into PseudoColor windows and have the colors still come out
	  semi-reasonably.

1.30	* Made `slidescreen' and `decayscreen' work better on SGIs when
	  windows of different visuals are present, by using the
	  XReadDisplay() extension to get a true 24-bit image out of the frame
	  buffer.
	* Made `noseguy' be in color, if compiled with XPM.
	* Ported `braid', `drift', `fract', `galaxy', `grav', `ifs', `julia',
	  `laser', `lightning', `penrose', `sierpinski', `slip', `spiral', and
	  `strange' hacks from xlockmore.
	* Merged `hopalong' hack with a more recent version.
	* Added `cde.txt'.

1.28	* Added `deco', `moire', and `kaleidescope' hacks.
	* Merged in support for non-Motif locking and demo mode.
	* Made `blitspin' and `bubbles' work in TrueColor.
	* Fixed a stupid bug I introduced in `imsmap'.
	* Added `poly' and `gravity' options to `qix'.

1.27	* Added support for SGI SCREEN_SAVER extension.
	* Made `fade' and `unfade' work on 8-bit SGIs.
	* Made the dialog boxes more Motify.
	* Added `bubbles' hack.

1.26	* Added `lmorph' hack.
	* Added viscosity and mouse-control to attraction.
	* Fixed possible bad color choices in qix and attraction.
	* Added ramp-mode to halo.
	* Added a new RNG, which is faster and more portable than using the
	  RNG in libc.
	* Made locking work on SCO.
	* Various other minor tweaks that I don't remember.

1.25	* Made it capture the stdout/stderr of its subprocesses and present
	  them on the screensaver window itself.
	* Made demo mode work correctly with non-default visuals and color
	  maps, instead of always using the defaults.
	* Added -visual argument to all included screenhacks.
	* Support for the R6 MIT-SCREEN-SAVER server extension.
	* Made the demo mode list scroll properly.
	* Added `pedal' hack.

1.24	* Fixed some private-colormap oddities in slidescreen, decayscreen,
	  and xroger.  Fixed apparent conservation- of-mass problem in pyro;
	  made the shrapnel round.

1.23	* Minor tweaks for IRIX5; fixed locking race condition.

1.22	* Minor tweaks for X11R6.
	* Fixes for non-default visuals.

1.21	* Fixed bug in color blitspin; added default image.
	* Added diagnostics to noseguy.  Fixed off-by-one error in flame.
	* Added some missing casts.

1.19	* Added `flame' hack.
	* Fixed a minor Motif dialog text field bug.
	* Fixed yet another XPointer-not-defined-in-R4 bug.

1.18	* Added support for shadow password files.
	* Fixed some Motif-related locking bugs.
	* Added diagnostics when locking is disabled.
	* Made blitspin able to use the XPM library.
	* Added `decayscreen' hack.

1.17	* Added `halo' hack.

1.16	* Portability fixes.

1.15	* Broke the driver up into more source files.
	* Moved the hacks into their own directory.
	* Made all `time' parameters accept the 00:00:00 syntax, so that even
	  the parameters which are normally read as minutes can be specified
	  in seconds.
	* Added colormap cycling to `imsmap'.
	* Made hyper work with K&R compilers.

1.14	* Added `orbit' option to `attraction' hack.
	* Added `lock-timeout' option.
	* Cleaned up options of `maze' hack.

1.09	* Added demo mode, and locking.
	* Added `maze' hack.
	* Added `norotate' option to `rocks' hack.

1.05	* Works when run from XDM before anyone logs in.
	* Sped up `imsmap'.
	* Can use `xv' as a slideshow without using up colormap entries while
	  the screen is not blanked.
	* Fixed a BadDrawable error in non-XIdle mode.
	* Added `blitspin' and `imsmap'.

1.01	* Current list of included hacks is now: qix, helix, rorschach,
	  attraction, greynetic, rocks, pyro, hopalong, and noseguy.
