            a screen saver and locker for the X window system
                            by Jamie Zawinski

To build on Unix:

  -  ./configure
  -  make
  -  make install

The `configure' shell script will attempt to figure out which options are
appropriate for your system, and will create config.h and the various
Makefiles for you.  Run `configure --help' to see how to override these
choices, or to specify things like the default installation directory.
The file `INSTALL' gives a general overview of use of these sorts of
configure scripts (those generated by the GNU autoconf system.)
The most important hint is probably this:

   ./configure --includedir=/opt/Motif/include --libdir=/opt/Motif/lib

To build on VMS, see README.VMS.

If you think you've found a bug, please let me know; but first, read
the enlosed `README.debugging' file to find out what kind of information
would be most helpful to include in your bug report.

Getting Started:

You can try out xscreensaver like so:

	xscreensaver &
	xscreensaver-command -demo

After a few seconds, the screen should go black, and a dialog box should
appear in the upper right corner.  This is "Demo Mode".

Note: unlike `xlock', xscreensaver has a client-server model: the
`xscreensaver' process is a daemon that runs in the background; it is
controlled by the foreground `xscreensaver-command' program.

xscreensaver has an extensive manual -- please read it!

                              ============

The xscreensaver program waits until the keyboard and mouse have been idle
for a period, and then runs a graphics demo chosen at random.  It turns off
as soon as there is any mouse or keyboard activity.

The purpose of xscreensaver is to display pretty pictures on your screen
when it is not in use, in keeping with the philosophy that unattended
monitors should always be doing something interesting, just like they do
in the movies.

However, xscreensaver can also be used as a screen locker, to prevent
others from using your terminal while your are away.

The benefit that this program has over the combination of the xlock and
xautolock programs is the ease with which new graphics hacks can be
installed: you don't need to recompile this program to add a new display
mode, you just change some resource settings.  Any program which can be
invoked in such a way that it draws on the root window of the screen can
now be used as a screensaver without modification.  The programs that
are being run as screensavers don't need to have any special knowledge
about what it means to be a screensaver.

The XIDLE, MIT-SCREEN-SAVER, and/or SGI SCREEN_SAVER server extensions
will be used if you have them.

The dialog boxes (for locking and demo-mode) look best using Motif or
Lesstif, but can be configured to use Athena widgets instead.

Also included are numerous graphics hacks for use as screensavers.  There's
nothing magic about these: they're just programs that draw on the root
window, which are pointed at by the screensaver's default resource settings.

   qix		- My own implementation of this, with many more options
		  than you would have thought qix could have.
   helix	- Generates spirally "stringart" patterns.
   pedal	- Draws a different kind of spirally pattern.
   rorschach	- Random inkblot patterns.

		  things.  I snarfed this code from xnlock.
   maze		- This is the X maze demo modified to take a -root option
		  so that it works with xscreensaver.
   lmorph	- morphing line drawings.
   bubbles	- condensation forms on your monitor, then pops.
   deco		- Generates Brady-Bunch-era wall paneling.

   lissie	- another lisajous path.
   goop		- Squishy transparent oil-and-bubble images
   starfish	- Radially-symmetric throbbing colormap-hacking blobs.
   munch	- The classic 1962-vintage "munching squares" hack.
   rd-bomb      - Reaction-diffusion fractals.
   coral        - Simulation of coral growth, sort of.
   fadeplot	- Draws a swimming ribbon.

   atlantis	- Draws swimming mammals (GLX only.)

All of these will pop up their own window unless given that -root option.
See their respective man pages for more details.

Other reasonable things to use as screensavers, if you have them, are

  xdaliclock -root -builtin2	- melting digital clock
  xswarm -r 2>&-		- swimming sperm
  xwave -root			- random 3d graphs
  xbouncebits			- bounce arbitrary bitmaps around

  xv -root file.gif -quit	- they don't all have to animate!
  xsplinefun			- bouncing splines
  xfishtank -c black -d -r 1	- fish (use version 2.0 or later)
  xmountains -b			- very realistic generated mountains
  xtacy -root			- various eye candy
  xearth -wait 0 -timewarp 400	- the earth as seen from space
  /usr/demos/bin/bongo		- an SGI GL demo
  /usr/demos/bin/ep -S		- another: the stunning ElectroPaint.
				  (Compile hacks/xscreensaver-sgigl.c
				  to use these with xscreensaver.)

You can get most of these from the contrib directory on ftp.x.org.  If you
know of (or write) any other interesting programs that can be used as
screensavers, please let me know!

Changes since 2.23:   * Tweaked the order of the -L options again.
		      * Cleaned up configure's --help message.
		      * Added `kumppa' hack.
		      * Smarter maze-solving algorithm in `maze'.
		      * Took `xlyap' out of the default list of hacks, since
			it's just incredibly buggy (and slow.)  Maybe someday
			someone will fix it...
		      * Added `distort' hack, but didn't add it to the default
			list (yet) because it's still too slow.
		      * Made the Athena demo dialog look more like the Motif
			version; it has a text-entry field now, too.
		      * Made the Athena password dialog echo asterisks, like
			Motif does, instead of using a flyspeck font.
		      * Some random configure tweaks.
		      * Added a `timestamp' resource that makes the `-verbose'
			messages include the time at which they were printed.
Changes since 2.22:   * The fix for SGI's "scheme" nonsense broke things, and
			let the user's "*background" resource show through.
			Fixed it in a different way.
Changes since 2.21:   * Added support for the DPMS server extension (Display
			Power Management System.)
		      * Made configure advertize the --enable-subdir option a
			little more, since that seemed to cause some people
			stress.  Also, made that directory be built into the
			xscreensaver executable, as a hardcoded prefix to
			$PATH.  (Might help, shouldn't hurt.)
		      * Made configure prefer the two-arg gettimeofday to the
			one-arg version, since AIX doesn't have any prototypes.
		      * Made it work with Xaw3d (the 3D Athena library.)
		      * Made "make install" create directories as necessary.
		      * New version of lmorph from Sverre.
		      * Added `crystal' and `discreet' hacks from xlockmore.
		      * Added a new mode to `bsod'.
Changes since 2.20:   * Made "xscreensaver-command -time" use different words.
			(It now describes the two states as "screen blanked
			since..."  and "screen non-blanked since..." instead of
			"active since..." and "inactive since..." which a lot
			of people interpreted as meaning the opposite of what
			was intended.)
		      * Improved some error messages, in the hopes of making
			the distinction between the xscreensaver and
			xscreensaver-command programs more obvious.
		      * Rewrote (and reorganized) parts of the xscreensaver and
			xscreensaver-command manual pages.
		      * Renamed xscreensaver's "-lock" command-line option to
			be "-lock-mode", to avoid confusion with the "-lock"
			option to xscreensaver-command, which does a totally
			different thing.
		      * Removed xscreensaver's "-demo" command-line option for
			a similar reason; use "xscreensaver-command -demo"
			instead.
		      * Disabled SGI's "scheme" nonsense in a better way than
			fully-qualifying the background colors in every single
			hack.
		      * Fixed some other minor cosmetic problems when *sgiMode
			is turned on.
		      * Fixed an X error in `bsod -root' (how ironic...)
Changes since 2.19:   * Fixed a bug that caused the mouse to sometimes not be
			grabbed properly (meaning the window manager menu could
			pop up over the demo-mode display.)
		      * Fixed a bug that made the stderr output sometimes get
			printed twice.
		      * Fixed a bug that made the demo-mode scrollbar move too
			fast.
		      * Protected against a possible buffer overflow.
		      * Made `vidwhacker' not leave stray xv windows around.
		      * New version of `ant' so that Bagley doesn't calve.
		      * Make configure on AIX get XShm from the right library.
Changes since 2.18:   * One file was missing from the tar file.	 Fixed.
Changes since 2.17:   * Oops, atlantis wasn't being built by default.  Fixed.

		      * Added `interference' hack.
		      * Added `truchet' hack.
		      * Added `bsod' hack.
		      * Added some new modes to `vidwhacker'.
Changes since 2.16:   * Added a -window-id argument to most hacks, so that they
			can draw on arbitrary externally-provided windows.
		      * Synched with xlockmore 4.11a01.
		      * Added `flow' hack.
		      * Added `atlantis' GL hack.
		      * Renamed `puzzle' hack to `jigsaw', since xlock already
			had a different mode called `puzzle'.
		      * Made it self-configure properly when Motif 2.1.0 is
			being used (requires -lXp now, sigh...)
Changes since 2.15:   * Made `flag' able to do XPM images.
		      * New look for the xscreensaver logo (`xroger').
		      * Fixed compilation error on Suns with adjunct passwords.
		      * Got multi-architecture builds working again.
		      * Some configure tweaks for building on HPUX and Solaris.
		      * Fixed bug in decayscreen.
		      * Fixed typo in passwd.c.
		      * Made `cynosure' not die when colormap is full.
Changes since 2.14:   * Added `cynosure' hack.

		      * Made unfading a bit smoother.
		      * Added `vidwhacker' hack (not installed by default.)
		      * Added `stairs' hack.
		      * Split `escher' into `cage' and `moebius', as per
			xlockmore.
		      * Changed subprocess handling to use sigaction() instead
			of signal() if it's available (this is necessary for
			SCO but should work fine on other systems too.)
		      * Various other tweaks.
Changes since 2.13:   * Better fix for the Motif drag-and-die lossage.
		      * Put in some kludges to work around a LessTif bug.
		      * XScreenSaver is known to work with LessTif 0.82 now.
		      * Made fading work on high-end SGI video hardware.
		      * Fixed another SGI-specific bug in screen grabbing;
			will the madness never cease?
		      * Fixed another crash in `xlyap'.
Changes since 2.12:   * Made `decayscreen' do directions other than down.
		      * Improved `puzzle'.
		      * Fixed a crash in `xlyap'.
		      * Added CDE info to the man page, removed `cde.txt'.
		      * Configure tweaks for Zippy.
		      * Turned off the signal handling in `bubbles' because
			it was sometimes failing to die.
		      * Added `hacks/xscreensaver-sgigl.c' to make it possible
			to run SGI's ElectroPaint hack (/usr/demos/bin/ep)
			with xscreensaver.  Finally!
		      * Fixed a buffer overrun in the locking code that some
			wily, malicious cracker must have slipped in.
		      * Disabled Motif drag-and-drool in the dialog box
			buttons, since it's broken in some old versions of
			Motif.
Changes since 2.11:   * Added `README.debugging'.
		      * Added `puzzle' hack.
		      * Added `xlyap' hack.
		      * Added "default-n" as a visual name, so that one can
			have -install on by default, but turn it off for
			certain poorly-behaved hacks (like xv.)
		      * Added support for grabbing frames of external video
			(on SGI) to the screen-grabbing hacks (decayscreen,
			slidescreen, slip, blitspin, and puzzle.)
		      * Improved look of tiles in `slidescreen'; fixed its
			color allocation problem.
Changes since 2.10:   * Tweaked `blitspin', added it to the default list.
		      * Added `lissie', `mountain', `triangle', `worm',
			`rotor', and `ant' from xlockmore.
		      * Updated `sierpinski', `galaxy', and `lisa'.

			more wipe styles.
		      * Fixed compilation problem with Sun's version of OpenGL.
		      * Added ability to use sigaction() instead of signal()
			to work around a SCO kernel bug.
