/*  First, some background: there are three distinct server extensions which
 *  are useful to a screen saver program: they are XIDLE, MIT-SCREEN-SAVER, 
 *  and SCREEN_SAVER.
 *
 *  The XIDLE extension resides in .../contrib/extensions/xidle/ on the X11R5
 *  contrib tape.  This extension lets the client get accurate idle-time 
 *  information from the X server in a potentially more reliable way than by
 *  simply watching for keyboard and mouse activity.  However, the XIDLE 
 *  extension has apparently not been ported to X11R6.
 *
 *  The SCREEN_SAVER extension is found (as far as I know) only in the SGI
 *  X server, and it exists in all releases since (at least) Irix 5.  The
 *  relevant header file is /usr/include/X11/extensions/XScreenSaver.h.
 *
 *  The similarly-named MIT-SCREEN-SAVER extension came into existence long
 *  after the SGI SCREEN_SAVER extension was already in use, and resides in
 *  .../contrib/extensions/screensaver/ on the X11R6 contrib tape.  It is
 *  also found in certain recent X servers built in to NCD X terminals.
 *
 *     The MIT extension does basically the same thing that the XIDLE extension
 *     does, but there are two things wrong with it: first, because of the way
 *     the extension was designed, the `fade' option to XScreenSaver will be
 *     uglier: just before the screen fades out, there will be an unattractive
 *     flicker to black, because this extension blanks the screen *before*
 *     telling us that it is time to do so.  Second, this extension is known to
 *     be buggy; on the systems I use, it works, but some people have reported
 *     X server crashes as a result of using it.  XScreenSaver uses this
 *     extension rather conservatively, because when I tried to use any of its
 *     more complicated features, I could get it to crash the server at the
 *     drop of a hat.
 *
 *     In short, the MIT-SCREEN-SAVER extension is a piece of junk.  The older
 *     SGI SCREEN_SAVER extension works great, as does XIDLE.  It would be nice
 *     If those two existed on more systems, that is, would be adopted by the
 *     X Consortium in favor of their inferior "not-invented-here" entry.

 *  lets XScreenSaver work better with servers which support this extension; 
 *  but it will still work with servers which do not suport it, so it's a good
 *  idea to compile in support for it if you can.
