This directory contains the Android-specific code for building xscreensaver.

It is preliminary, and very much a work in progress.

If you're messing with this, please let us know!

To set up your Android development environment:

    Install JDK 7 (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/)
    Install Android Studio (http://developer.android.com/sdk/)
    Install Android NDK (http://developer.android.com/ndk/downloads)
      Rename or link the "android-ndk-*" directory to "ndk" inside your
      $ANDROID_HOME (the "sdk/" directory that is the parent of
      "build-tools/", etc.)  That is, it should be "sdk/ndk/".

    set $ANDROID_HOME to where your SDK is installed, or
    set "sdk.dir" in project/local.properties.
    On MacOS, the value you want is probably ~/Library/Android/sdk/
    Also set "ndk.dir" in project/local.properties.

To build:

    ./configure
    cd android
    make

    Hopefully an "xscreensaver-debug.apk" file will appear in
    android/project/xscreensaver/build/outputs/apk/.

    Load that onto your device and go to:
      Settings / Display / Daydream
    or just click on the XScreenSaver icon, which is a shortcut to that.

    To create and configure an emulator image, use the GUI tool and and
    give the emulator a name (say, "Nexus_5").

      $ANDROID_HOME/sdk/tools/android avd

      E.g.: Nexus 5, Android 5, Intel Atom x86_64, RAM 2048 VM 64,
        storage 200, use host GPU.

    Configuration options are in $HOME/.android/avd/*.avd/config.ini

    To launch it:

      $ANDROID_HOME/sdk/tools/emulator -avd Nexus_5

    Warning!  On my system at least, the emulator runs out of memory
    when trying to display the Daydream page if all of the savers are
    loaded.  This is troubling.  You can work around this by editing
    your *.avd/config.ini and setting vm.heapSize=128; or by editing
    android/Makefile and paring down the $ANDROID_HACKS list to a
    smaller subset (60 or so with the default heapSize).


    To load it into the currently-running emulator or device:
      $ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools/adb install -r \
        project/xscreensaver/build/outputs/apk/xscreensaver-debug.apk

    Extremely verbose log output, including stack traces:
        $ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools/adb logcat

    Non-fatal log output for only this app:
        $ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools/adb logcat \
          -s xscreensaver:d AndroidRuntime:d libEGL:d

    Note that sometimes "logcat" will just sit there forever saying
    "waiting for device".  This is because the emulator is a piece of
    shit and sometimes decides to just randomly not service connections.
    If you restart the emulator, and wait minutes for the whole damned
    thing to boot up again, it will probably work next time.  Probably.


Directory structure:

    Boilerplate for the Java version of "make":
        project/*gradle*
        project/*.properties
        project/xscreensaver/*gradle*
        project/xscreensaver/build.*
        project/xscreensaver/*.properties

    The other half of the Makefile:
        project/xscreensaver/jni/*.mk

    Source code:
        project/xscreensaver/src/org/jwz/xscreensaver/*.java
        project/xscreensaver/res/layout/*.xml

    Other relevant source code is in ../jwxyz/ and ../hacks/.

    Icons:
        project/xscreensaver/res/drawable-ldpi/
        project/xscreensaver/res/drawable-mdpi/
        project/xscreensaver/res/drawable/

    Files that we generate:

        gen/function-table.h
        project/xscreensaver/AndroidManifest.xml
        project/xscreensaver/res/drawable/*.png
        project/xscreensaver/res/values/settings.xml
        project/xscreensaver/res/values/strings.xml
        project/xscreensaver/res/xml/*.xml
        project/xscreensaver/src/org/jwz/xscreensaver/gen/*.java

    Other files generated as a part of the build process:

        gen/
        project/.gradle/
        project/xscreensaver/build/
        project/xscreensaver/build/outputs/apk/  -- app appears here
        project/xscreensaver/jni/
        project/xscreensaver/libs/
        project/xscreensaver/obj/
        project/xscreensaver/res/
        project/xscreensaver/res/drawable/
        project/xscreensaver/res/values/
        project/xscreensaver/res/xml/
        project/xscreensaver/src/org/jwz/xscreensaver/gen/

When adding a new hack, edit android/Makefile, then "make clean" and "make".


TODO list, and known bugs:

  - See the top of ../jwxyz/jwxyz-gl.c for a low level TODO list,
    but here's what's wrong with the savers from a high level view:

  - Rotation is wonky (on some devices?)

  - The Android emulator is a piece of shit and crashes all the time,
    so it's possible that some of these work fine on real devices.
    I don't actually have an Android device, so I have no idea.

  - As mentioned above, the Android emulator runs out of memory if
    more than about 60 of the Daydreams are installed with the default
    heapSize.  Again, I don't know if this is an issue on real devices.
    I sure hope not.

  - The code that attempts to grab a screen shot before the Daydream begins
    doesn't work.

  - When a saver exits abnormally, we catch the exception and attempt to 
    display the error message in a dialog.  The catch works, but the dialog
    box does not.
